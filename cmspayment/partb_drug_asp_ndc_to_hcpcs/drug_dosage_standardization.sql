-- Title: Drug Dosage Standardization Analysis

-- Business Purpose: Analyzes variation in drug dosage practices to:
-- - Identify opportunities for dosage standardization across manufacturers
-- - Support clinical protocol development
-- - Highlight potential cost savings through optimal dosing strategies
-- - Facilitate medication safety through clear dosing patterns

WITH latest_data AS (
    -- Get the most recent data snapshot
    SELECT MAX(mimi_src_file_date) as max_date
    FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.partb_drug_asp_ndc_to_hcpcs
),

dosage_patterns AS (
    -- Analyze dosage patterns by HCPCS code
    SELECT 
        hcpcs_code,
        short_descriptor,
        hcpcs_dosage,
        COUNT(DISTINCT ndc) as ndc_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT labeler_name) as manufacturer_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT billunits) as billing_unit_variations
    FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.partb_drug_asp_ndc_to_hcpcs a
    WHERE mimi_src_file_date = (SELECT max_date FROM latest_data)
    GROUP BY hcpcs_code, short_descriptor, hcpcs_dosage
)

SELECT 
    hcpcs_code,
    short_descriptor,
    hcpcs_dosage,
    ndc_count,
    manufacturer_count,
    billing_unit_variations,
    -- Flag potential standardization opportunities
    CASE 
        WHEN billing_unit_variations > 1 THEN 'Review Needed'
        WHEN manufacturer_count > 3 THEN 'Multiple Manufacturers'
        ELSE 'Standardized'
    END as standardization_status
FROM dosage_patterns
WHERE ndc_count > 1  -- Focus on drugs with multiple NDCs
ORDER BY billing_unit_variations DESC, ndc_count DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Identifies the latest data snapshot
-- 2. Groups drugs by HCPCS code to analyze dosage patterns
-- 3. Counts variations in NDCs, manufacturers, and billing units
-- 4. Flags potential areas for standardization review
-- 5. Returns top 100 results sorted by variation complexity

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes current data snapshot is representative
-- - Limited to top 100 results for initial analysis
-- - Does not account for therapeutic equivalence
-- - Does not consider historical changes in dosing patterns

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add temporal analysis to track dosage pattern changes
-- 2. Include package size analysis for efficiency
-- 3. Cross-reference with pricing data for cost impact
-- 4. Add therapeutic class grouping
-- 5. Incorporate clinical guidelines for dosing recommendations

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on identifying variations in drug dosing practices across manufacturers and billing units. Best used in conjunction with clinical protocols and cost analysis. Performance may be impacted with very large datasets due to multiple GROUP BY operations.
