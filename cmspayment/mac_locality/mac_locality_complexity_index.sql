-- Business Purpose: Calculate a Payment Complexity Index for MAC Localities
-- Helps healthcare administrators and policymakers understand the administrative
-- variation across Medicare regions by analyzing MAC locality characteristics

-- Query Functionality:
-- 1. Calculates a complexity index for each MAC locality
-- 2. Aggregates complexity at the state level
-- 3. Ranks states by their administrative complexity
-- 4. Categorizes states into complexity levels

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Complexity is based on carrier and locality count
-- - Logarithmic scaling prevents extreme outliers
-- - Does not account for population or budget differences
-- - Snapshot of current MAC locality configuration

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Add population-weighted complexity calculation
-- 2. Integrate with Medicare payment data
-- 3. Time-series analysis of complexity changes
-- 4. Correlate complexity with healthcare access metrics

    - Additional Notes: This query provides a multidimensional complexity scoring mechanism for Medicare Administrative Contractor localities, focusing on identifying administrative variation across different states. The complexity index uses logarithmic scaling to prevent extreme outliers and offers a nuanced view of regional administrative complexity.
