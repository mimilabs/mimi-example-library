-- MAC Locality Coverage Gaps Analysis
-- Business Purpose: Identify potential gaps or overlaps in Medicare administrative coverage
-- by analyzing MAC locality assignments and detecting areas that may have missing or
-- duplicate locality numbers within states, which could impact service delivery and claims processing.

WITH current_localities AS (
    -- Get the most recent locality assignments based on file date
    SELECT 
        state_name,
        state_abbr,
        mac_id,
        CAST(locality_number AS INT) as locality_number,
        mimi_src_file_date
    FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.mac_locality
    WHERE mimi_src_file_date = (
        SELECT MAX(mimi_src_file_date) 
        FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.mac_locality
    )
),

    -- Calculate locality number patterns per state
    SELECT 
        state_name,
        state_abbr,
        COUNT(DISTINCT locality_number) as unique_localities,
        MIN(locality_number) as min_locality,

    FROM current_localities
    GROUP BY state_name, state_abbr
)

SELECT

    CASE 
        WHEN (max_locality - min_locality + 1) > unique_localities THEN 'Potential Gaps'

    (unique_localities - (max_locality - min_locality + 1)) as locality_difference
FROM locality_stats
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN (max_locality - min_locality + 1) > unique_localities THEN 1

-- How this works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE for the most recent locality data, converting locality_number to INTEGER
-- 2. Calculates key statistics about locality number patterns within each state
-- 3. Identifies potential coverage issues by comparing expected vs actual locality counts
-- 4. Flags states with unusual patterns that might indicate administrative gaps

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes locality_number can be converted to INTEGER
-- - Assumes sequential locality numbering within states is intended
-- - Relies on mimi_src_file_date for currency of data
-- - Does not account for intentional gaps in locality numbering
-- - Coverage patterns may be legitimate due to state-specific requirements

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic clustering analysis to identify regional patterns
-- 2. Include historical trend analysis of coverage changes
-- 3. Incorporate population or beneficiary data to assess impact
-- 4. Add details about specific missing locality numbers
-- 5. Compare coverage patterns with quality metrics or payment data

    - Additional Notes: Query requires locality_number values to be convertible to integers. Results may need validation against official MAC jurisdiction maps as some gaps might be intentional due to regional administrative boundaries. Best used as a preliminary screening tool for identifying potential coverage anomalies.
