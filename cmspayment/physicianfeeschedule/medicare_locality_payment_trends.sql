-- Title: Analysis of Medicare Payment Locality Variations and Trends

-- Business Purpose: This query analyzes geographic payment variations and year-over-year 
-- trends in Medicare physician fee schedule reimbursement. The insights support:
-- - Network strategy and provider contracting decisions
-- - Fair market value assessments for new locations/markets
-- - Understanding of payment equity across regions
-- - Price benchmarking for common procedures

/* How the Query Works:
1. Filters to active services without modifiers to focus on standard payments
2. Groups by key dimensions to analyze geographic and temporal patterns
3. Calculates payment statistics and year-over-year changes
4. Orders results to highlight trends and variations

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Focuses on non-facility payments only
- Excludes modified payments that may apply in specific scenarios
- Year-over-year changes require data from consecutive years
- Geographic variations may be justified by cost-of-living differences

Possible Extensions:
1. Add service volume weighting using Medicare utilization data
2. Compare facility vs non-facility payment variations
3. Analyze specific high-volume or high-cost procedure codes
4. Include demographic data to assess payment equity
5. Add statistical measures like standard deviation and percentiles

    - Additional Notes: Script requires at least 2 consecutive years of data for year-over-year comparisons. Payment variations should be interpreted in context of regional cost differences. Results are limited to standard non-facility payments for active services without modifiers.
