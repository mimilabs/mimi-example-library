-- Medicare Part B Drug Package Cost Normalization Analysis
-- Business Purpose:
-- - Calculate and compare normalized drug costs across different package sizes
-- - Identify cost-effective packaging options for drug procurement
-- - Support contracting decisions and value-based purchasing initiatives
-- - Enable fair price comparisons across manufacturers

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Uses CTE to prepare normalized data for each unique drug package
-- 2. Extracts numeric dosage values for potential calculations
-- 3. Calculates normalized billing units for comparison
-- 4. Provides package efficiency metrics and variation counts
-- 5. Filters for active packages with positive billing units

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes billing units are consistently recorded across packages
-- - Limited to latest available data only
-- - Does not account for stability or storage requirements
-- - Package size efficiency may not directly correlate with cost efficiency

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add time-series analysis to track package size evolution
-- 2. Include price data to calculate cost per normalized unit
-- 3. Add therapeutic class grouping for category-level analysis
-- 4. Incorporate waste analysis based on common prescription patterns
-- 5. Compare package efficiency across similar drug classes

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on standardizing drug package comparisons but requires additional pricing data for full cost analysis. Dosage extraction may need adjustment based on specific format patterns in the data. Package efficiency calculations assume uniform measurement units across products.
