-- Medicare Part B Drug Dosage Standardization Analysis
-- Business Purpose:
-- - Analyze standardization of drug dosages across manufacturers
-- - Identify potential pricing variations due to dosage differences
-- - Support clinical and formulary decision-making
-- - Enable more accurate price comparisons between similar products

WITH DosageStats AS (
    -- Standardize and analyze dosage patterns for each generic drug
    SELECT 
        drug_generic_name,
        COUNT(DISTINCT dosage) as unique_dosage_forms,
        COUNT(DISTINCT labeler_name) as manufacturer_count,
        -- Using collect_set instead of STRING_AGG for Databricks SQL
        collect_set(dosage) as dosage_variations,
        COUNT(DISTINCT ndc) as total_ndcs
    FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.partb_drug_noc_ndc_to_hcpcs
    WHERE drug_generic_name IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY drug_generic_name
),

ComplexityMetrics AS (
    -- Calculate complexity metrics for dosage standardization
    SELECT
        drug_generic_name,
        unique_dosage_forms,
        manufacturer_count,
        array_join(dosage_variations, ', ') as dosage_variations_str,
        total_ndcs,
        -- Complexity score: higher ratio indicates more dosage variations per manufacturer
        ROUND(CAST(unique_dosage_forms AS FLOAT) / manufacturer_count, 2) as dosage_complexity_ratio
    FROM DosageStats
)

SELECT 
    drug_generic_name,
    manufacturer_count,
    unique_dosage_forms,
    total_ndcs,
    dosage_complexity_ratio,
    dosage_variations_str
FROM ComplexityMetrics
WHERE manufacturer_count > 1  -- Focus on drugs with multiple manufacturers
ORDER BY dosage_complexity_ratio DESC, manufacturer_count DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. First CTE aggregates dosage information by generic drug name
-- 2. Second CTE calculates a complexity ratio to measure dosage standardization
-- 3. Final output shows drugs with highest variation in dosage forms relative to manufacturer count

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes dosage fields are consistently formatted
-- - Does not account for therapeutic equivalence
-- - Limited to drugs with multiple manufacturers
-- - Does not consider temporal changes in dosage patterns

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add trend analysis by incorporating mimi_src_file_date
-- 2. Include billing unit analysis to validate dosage standardization
-- 3. Add therapeutic classification grouping
-- 4. Compare dosage patterns between brand and generic versions
-- 5. Calculate potential cost implications of dosage variations

    - Additional Notes: Query calculates a dosage complexity ratio (unique dosage forms per manufacturer) to identify drugs with high dosage variation patterns. Higher ratios may indicate opportunities for dosage standardization or areas requiring careful formulary management. Results are filtered to show only drugs with multiple manufacturers to focus on products where standardization could have meaningful impact.
