-- Title: Part B Drug Utilization by Package Size Analysis 

-- Business Purpose:
-- - Identify potential dosage and package optimization opportunities
-- - Support pharmacy benefit contracting decisions
-- - Enable cost-effective drug dispensing and inventory management
-- - Highlight drug formulations with multiple package size options

-- Main Query
SELECT 
    -- Core drug identifiers and descriptions
    d.hcpcs_code,
    d.drug_name,
    d.labeler_name,
    d.short_descriptor,
    
    -- Package metrics
    d.pkg_size,
    COUNT(DISTINCT d.ndc) as ndc_count,
    
    -- Analyze billing units patterns
    MIN(d.billunits) as min_billunits,
    MAX(d.billunits) as max_billunits,
    AVG(d.billunitspkg) as avg_billunits_per_pkg,
    
    -- Track data recency
    MAX(d.mimi_src_file_date) as latest_data_date

FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.partb_drug_awp_ndc_to_hcpcs d

-- Focus on most recent data
WHERE d.mimi_src_file_date = (
    SELECT MAX(mimi_src_file_date) 
    FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.partb_drug_awp_ndc_to_hcpcs
)

-- Group metrics by key drug attributes
GROUP BY 
    d.hcpcs_code,
    d.drug_name,
    d.labeler_name,
    d.short_descriptor,
    d.pkg_size

-- Order by drugs with most package variations first    
ORDER BY 
    ndc_count DESC,
    drug_name

-- Limit to top entries for initial analysis
LIMIT 100;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Identifies unique drug products by HCPCS code and package size
-- 2. Calculates key metrics around billing units and NDC variations
-- 3. Groups results to show package size distribution patterns
-- 4. Uses latest available data for current state analysis

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes package size data is consistently formatted
-- - Limited to Part B drugs only
-- - Does not account for drug potency/concentration
-- - Historical trends not included in base analysis

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add therapeutic class grouping
-- 2. Include quarter-over-quarter package size changes
-- 3. Calculate average billing units per dispensing
-- 4. Compare brand vs generic packaging patterns
-- 5. Add filters for specific drug classes or manufacturers

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on package size distribution and billing unit patterns to support pharmacy inventory and contracting decisions. Best used for initial package size optimization analysis and manufacturer comparisons. Consider memory usage when removing the LIMIT clause for full dataset analysis.
