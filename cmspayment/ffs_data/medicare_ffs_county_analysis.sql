-- Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) Payment Analysis by County
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze Medicare FFS reimbursement patterns across counties to:
-- 1. Identify high-spending regions for strategic planning
-- 2. Compare Part A and Part B reimbursement patterns
-- 3. Support Medicare Advantage market entry decisions

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Groups FFS payments by geography
-- 2. Calculates average reimbursements for both Part A and Part B
-- 3. Includes key hospital payment adjustments (IME, DSH, GME)
-- 4. Filters for counties with significant Medicare population
--
-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes reimbursement values are normalized and in consistent units
-- - Requires at least 1000 Part A enrollees per county for meaningful analysis
-- - IME/DSH/GME only applicable to hospital payments
--
-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add time-based analysis using mimi_src_file_date
-- 2. Calculate ratio of Part A to Part B spending
-- 3. Compare regular reimbursement vs adjusted (wo_imedshgme) amounts
-- 4. Add geographic clustering analysis
-- 5. Analyze relationship between enrollment and per-capita costs
-- 6. Compare hospital payment adjustments across regions

    - Additional Notes: Query aggregates Medicare Fee-For-Service payments at county level, focusing on Part A and B reimbursements, enrollment metrics, and hospital payment adjustments (IME/DSH/GME). Minimum threshold of 1000 Part A enrollees per county ensures statistical significance. Results are ordered by Part A reimbursement to highlight high-cost regions.
