-- 3. Provides a comprehensive view of historical data publication trends

-- Assumptions:
-- - Assumes consistent metadata collection across years
-- - May not capture all nuances of dataset changes
-- - Relies on web-scraped metadata accuracy

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Add temporal trend analysis of dataset descriptions
-- 2. Integrate with actual fee schedule data for deeper insights
-- 3. Create visualization of dataset publication patterns
