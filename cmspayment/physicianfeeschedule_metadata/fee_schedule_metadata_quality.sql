-- cms_fee_schedule_dataset_assessment.sql
-- Business Purpose: 
-- Assess the CMS Physician Fee Schedule metadata to identify:
-- - Which years have the most complete and detailed dataset descriptions
-- - Quality of documentation across time periods
-- - Potential gaps in dataset descriptions
-- This helps data teams prioritize which datasets to analyze first and identify
-- where additional documentation research may be needed.

  SELECT 
    year,

     CASE WHEN file_url IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +
     CASE WHEN comment IS NOT NULL AND LENGTH(comment) > 20 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as metadata_score,

/* How this query works:
1. Creates scoring CTE that evaluates completeness of key metadata fields
2. Assigns points for presence of URLs and meaningful descriptions
3. Main query adds quality classification and preview of description
4. Orders by year to show most recent datasets first

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Simple scoring system may not capture all quality aspects
- Comment length used as proxy for documentation detail
- Does not validate actual accessibility of URLs
- Quality assessment is relative within available data

Possible Extensions:
1. Add pattern matching to identify specific content in comments
2. Compare against previous year metadata scores to show trends
3. Generate automated data quality alerts for low scores
4. Cross reference with actual fee schedule data availability
5. Add validation of URL accessibility

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on metadata quality scoring rather than raw inventory tracking. The scoring system (0-3 points) provides a quick way to identify which datasets have complete documentation, though the thresholds for quality levels (High/Moderate/Needs Review) may need adjustment based on specific organizational standards. Consider that comment length alone may not be the best proxy for documentation quality.
