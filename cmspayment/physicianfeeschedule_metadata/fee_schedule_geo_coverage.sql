-- cms_fee_schedule_geographical_coverage.sql
-- Business Purpose: Analyzes the geographical reach of CMS physician fee schedules 
-- by analyzing file URLs and dataset patterns to help:
-- - Identify state-specific vs national fee schedule coverage
-- - Track regional payment variations over time
-- - Support market access and reimbursement strategy decisions

WITH parsed_urls AS (
  -- Extract geographical identifiers from file URLs and comments
  SELECT 
    year,
    file_url,
    comment,
    CASE 
      WHEN LOWER(file_url) LIKE '%national%' THEN 'National'
      WHEN LOWER(file_url) LIKE '%locality%' THEN 'Locality-Based'
      WHEN REGEXP_EXTRACT(LOWER(file_url), '[a-z]{2}\d{2}', 0) IS NOT NULL THEN 'State-Specific'
      ELSE 'Other'
    END AS coverage_type
  FROM mimi_ws_1.cmspayment.physicianfeeschedule_metadata
),

coverage_summary AS (
  -- Summarize coverage patterns by year
  SELECT
    year,
    coverage_type,
    COUNT(*) as dataset_count,
    ARRAY_JOIN(COLLECT_LIST(file_url), '; ') as example_files
  FROM parsed_urls
  GROUP BY year, coverage_type
)

-- Final output showing geographical coverage trends
SELECT 
  year,
  coverage_type,
  dataset_count,
  example_files
FROM coverage_summary
ORDER BY year DESC, coverage_type;

-- How it works:
-- 1. Parses file URLs to identify geographical scope using pattern matching
-- 2. Categorizes datasets into National, Locality-Based, State-Specific, or Other
-- 3. Aggregates results by year and coverage type with example files
-- 4. Returns chronological view of geographical coverage patterns

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Relies on consistent URL/filename patterns for geographical identification
-- - May not capture all geographical nuances in dataset descriptions
-- - Coverage categorization based on limited pattern matching rules

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add specific state/locality extraction for finer geographical analysis
-- 2. Compare coverage patterns with Medicare enrollment demographics
-- 3. Include payment rate variations across geographical regions
-- 4. Map coverage gaps and opportunities for specific specialties
-- 5. Analyze relationship between geography and payment policy changes

    - Additional Notes: Query relies on URL pattern matching which may need periodic updates as CMS file naming conventions change. The COLLECT_LIST function used for aggregation may need adjustment for very large datasets due to memory constraints.
