-- Title: DMEPOS Product Transition and Continuity Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- - Identify products that have undergone HCPCS code transitions
-- - Analyze product continuity and coding changes over time
-- - Support compliance and billing accuracy by tracking historical code assignments
-- - Help suppliers understand product coding history for proper claims submission

WITH product_transitions AS (
    -- Get products with multiple HCPCS codes or date ranges
    SELECT 
        product_name,
        manufacturer,
        model_number,
        COUNT(DISTINCT hcpcs_code) as code_changes,
        MIN(effective_date) as first_effective_date,
        MAX(COALESCE(end_date, CURRENT_DATE)) as latest_end_date,
        -- Collect all HCPCS codes as array to see transition history
        COLLECT_LIST(DISTINCT hcpcs_code) as hcpcs_history
    FROM mimi_ws_1.palmettogba.dmecs
    GROUP BY 
        product_name,
        manufacturer,
        model_number
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT hcpcs_code) > 1
)

SELECT 
    manufacturer,
    product_name,
    model_number,
    code_changes,
    first_effective_date,
    latest_end_date,
    -- Calculate duration in days between first and last dates
    DATEDIFF(latest_end_date, first_effective_date) as total_coverage_days,
    -- Convert array to string for readable display
    ARRAY_JOIN(hcpcs_history, ' -> ') as hcpcs_transition_path
FROM product_transitions
-- Focus on significant transitions (more than 2 codes)
WHERE code_changes >= 2
ORDER BY 
    code_changes DESC,
    total_coverage_days DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates CTE to identify products with multiple HCPCS codes
-- 2. Groups by product identifiers to find transition patterns
-- 3. Calculates duration and transition metrics
-- 4. Orders results by number of changes and coverage period
-- 5. Shows historical path of HCPCS code assignments

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes product_name + manufacturer + model_number uniquely identifies products
-- - Limited to products with actual code changes (excludes stable assignments)
-- - Does not account for gaps in coverage periods
-- - May include administrative updates rather than true coding changes

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add analysis of common transition patterns between specific HCPCS codes
-- 2. Include time duration between successive code changes
-- 3. Correlate transitions with specific regulatory changes or policy updates
-- 4. Compare transition patterns across different product categories
-- 5. Analyze seasonal patterns in code transitions
-- 6. Add validation for overlapping date ranges

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on tracking healthcare equipment products that have undergone HCPCS code changes over time, which is crucial for billing compliance and historical tracking. Note that results are limited to top 100 products with multiple code assignments and may need adjustment based on specific date ranges of interest.
