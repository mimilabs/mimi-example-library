-- Title: DMEPOS Product Lifecycle and Complexity Insights

-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze the complexity and lifecycle characteristics of medical equipment products
-- Provide insights into product longevity, manufacturer coding practices, 
-- and potential market dynamics in the Durable Medical Equipment space

-- Query Explanation:
-- 1. Calculates product lifecycle metrics at individual product level
-- 2. Aggregates metrics at manufacturer level
-- 3. Provides insights into product diversity, longevity, and naming complexity
-- 4. Categorizes manufacturers by product portfolio complexity

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes consistent and accurate date reporting
-- - Limited to HCPCS code and product name analysis
-- - Does not include actual sales or utilization data

-- Potential Query Extensions:
-- 1. Add time-series analysis of product introductions
-- 2. Incorporate pricing or claims data for deeper insights
-- 3. Analyze seasonal patterns in product coding
