Business Purpose:
- Analyze demographic patterns in adverse event reporting to identify 
  vulnerable populations and support targeted drug safety monitoring
- Enable healthcare organizations to better understand patient populations
  at higher risk for adverse events
- Inform patient education and risk management strategies based on 
  demographic insights

/*** 
How it works:
1. Creates demographic segments based on age group and gender
2. Calculates key metrics including report volumes and severity rates
3. Provides insights into demographic risk patterns
4. Filters for recent data (2023+) to focus on current patterns

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes demographic fields are accurately reported
- Limited by completeness of optional demographic data
- Geographic patterns may be influenced by reporting practices
- Age groups may not be consistently defined across regions

Possible Extensions:
1. Add time-based trending to analyze demographic shifts
2. Include specific drug categories or therapeutic areas
3. Compare demographic patterns across different countries
4. Analyze seasonal or temporal patterns by demographic group
5. Include specific reaction types or outcomes by demographic

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on risk stratification across demographic groups, enabling identification of vulnerable populations. Note that the '2023-01-01' filter may need adjustment based on data availability and analysis timeframe requirements. Demographics fields (age_group, sex) have known data completeness issues that could affect analysis reliability.
