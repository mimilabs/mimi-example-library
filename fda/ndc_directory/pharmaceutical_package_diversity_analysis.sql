/* 
Query Mechanics:
- Uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for modular analysis
- Focuses on active pharmaceutical products
- Provides multi-dimensional view of packaging diversity

Key Assumptions:
- Considers only products with non-expired marketing dates
- Market share calculated based on package count
- Ranks manufacturers by total package diversity

Potential Extensions:
1. Add time-series analysis of market entry/exit
2. Incorporate active ingredient complexity
3. Segment by marketing category or DEA schedule
4. Compare generic vs. brand-name product diversity
