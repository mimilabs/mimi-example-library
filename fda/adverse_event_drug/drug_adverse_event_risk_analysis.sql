-- FDA Adverse Drug Event Analysis: Drug Characterization and Risk Assessment

/*
Business Purpose:
This query provides a comprehensive analysis of drug adverse events, focusing on:
- Identifying the most frequently reported drugs in adverse event reports
- Characterizing the roles of drugs in these events
- Understanding potential drug safety signals
- Supporting pharmaceutical risk management and patient safety initiatives

/*
How the Query Works:
- Uses Common Table Expression (CTE) to aggregate drug adverse event data
- Calculates total reports, suspect drug reports, and average dosage
- Ranks drugs by total adverse event reports
- Filters to focus on drugs with more than 10 reported events

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Data is based on voluntary FDA adverse event reporting
- Does not confirm causation, only correlation
- Reporting bias may exist
- Limited by data completeness and accuracy

Potential Extensions:
1. Add severity analysis by linking to adverse_event_base
2. Incorporate time-based trending of drug adverse events
3. Compare drug safety across different administration routes
4. Analyze drug interactions and cumulative risk factors
