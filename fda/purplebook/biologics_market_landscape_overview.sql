-- biologics_therapeutic_landscape_analysis.sql
-- Business Purpose:
-- Provide a comprehensive overview of the FDA-licensed biological products' therapeutic landscape
-- Key insights include:
-- 1. Distribution of biologics across different routes of administration
-- 2. Marketing status breakdown
-- 3. Trends in product types and licensing

WITH biologics_summary AS (
    -- Aggregate key metrics for biologics products
    SELECT 
        route_of_administration,
        marketing_status,
        COUNT(DISTINCT nru) AS total_unique_products,
        COUNT(DISTINCT applicant) AS unique_manufacturers,
        AVG(DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, approval_date)) AS avg_time_since_approval
    FROM mimi_ws_1.fda.purplebook
    WHERE marketing_status IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        route_of_administration, 
        marketing_status
),

manufacturer_rankings AS (
    -- Rank manufacturers by number of licensed products
    SELECT 
        applicant,
        COUNT(DISTINCT nru) AS product_count,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT nru) DESC) AS manufacturer_rank
    FROM mimi_ws_1.fda.purplebook
    GROUP BY applicant
)

-- Final analysis query combining summary insights
SELECT 
    bs.route_of_administration,
    bs.marketing_status,
    bs.total_unique_products,
    bs.unique_manufacturers,
    bs.avg_time_since_approval,
    mr.manufacturer_rank,
    mr.product_count AS top_manufacturer_product_count
FROM biologics_summary bs
JOIN manufacturer_rankings mr ON bs.unique_manufacturers = mr.product_count
ORDER BY 
    bs.total_unique_products DESC,
    bs.avg_time_since_approval DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- Query Mechanics:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to summarize biologics by route and marketing status
-- 2. Generates a manufacturer ranking based on product count
-- 3. Joins summary insights with manufacturer rankings
-- 4. Provides a holistic view of the biologics landscape

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses current snapshot of FDA Purple Book
-- - Focuses on aggregate-level insights
-- - May not capture real-time market changes

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Add time-series analysis of approvals
-- 2. Incorporate dosage form and strength dimensions
-- 3. Analyze exclusivity periods and market dynamics
