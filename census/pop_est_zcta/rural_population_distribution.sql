-- rural_communities_analysis.sql

-- Business Purpose:
-- - Identify and analyze rural communities (ZCTAs with population < 10,000)
-- - Support strategic planning for rural healthcare programs and services
-- - Provide insights for resource allocation in less populated areas
-- - Guide decisions for mobile health services and telehealth initiatives

-- Main Query
WITH rural_zcta_analysis AS (
  SELECT 
    zcta,
    tot_population_est,
    CASE 
      WHEN tot_population_est < 2500 THEN 'Very Rural'
      WHEN tot_population_est BETWEEN 2500 AND 5000 THEN 'Moderately Rural'
      WHEN tot_population_est BETWEEN 5001 AND 10000 THEN 'Semi-Rural'
      ELSE 'Non-Rural'
    END AS rural_classification
  FROM mimi_ws_1.census.pop_est_zcta
  WHERE year = 2020
)

SELECT 
  rural_classification,
  COUNT(*) as num_zctas,
  SUM(tot_population_est) as total_population,
  ROUND(AVG(tot_population_est), 0) as avg_population,
  ROUND(MIN(tot_population_est), 0) as min_population,
  ROUND(MAX(tot_population_est), 0) as max_population

GROUP BY rural_classification
ORDER BY

  END;

-- How the Query Works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE that classifies ZCTAs into rural categories based on population
-- 2. Calculates key statistics for each rural classification
-- 3. Presents results ordered by rural classification level

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses 2020 population data only
-- - Assumes rural classification based on population thresholds
-- - Does not account for geographic proximity to urban areas
-- - Does not consider state-specific rural definitions
-- - Simple population-based classification may not capture all aspects of rurality

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic region analysis to identify regional patterns in rural communities
-- 2. Include year-over-year population changes to track rural population trends
-- 3. Incorporate distance to nearest urban center for more refined rural classification
-- 4. Add analysis of surrounding ZCTA populations for context
-- 5. Calculate percentage of state population living in rural areas
-- 6. Include economic or healthcare access metrics for rural communities
-- 7. Add seasonal population variation analysis for tourist areas

    - Additional Notes: Query uses fixed population thresholds (2500, 5000, 10000) for rural classification which may need adjustment based on specific regional or organizational definitions of rural areas. Results may be more meaningful when combined with additional geographic or demographic context.
