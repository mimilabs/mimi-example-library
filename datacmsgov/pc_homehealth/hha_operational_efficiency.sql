-- Home Health Agency Service Area and Operations Efficiency Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- Examines the efficiency and service area coverage of home health agencies by:
-- 1. Identifying agencies serving multiple states vs single state operations
-- 2. Analyzing the relationship between organizational structure and service scope
-- 3. Highlighting operational efficiency patterns through NPI utilization

    -- Calculate number of states each agency operates in

-- How the Query Works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to aggregate state and NPI counts per agency
-- 2. Classifies agencies into operational scope categories
-- 3. Calculates key operational metrics and efficiency ratios
-- 4. Groups results by scope, structure, and profit status

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes current enrollment state represents active operations
-- 2. NPI count serves as proxy for operational complexity
-- 3. Does not account for temporal changes in service area
-- 4. Multiple NPIs might indicate inefficiency or specialization

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add temporal analysis to track expansion patterns
-- 2. Include CCN counts to measure facility relationships
-- 3. Incorporate geographic distance calculations
-- 4. Add revenue or size metrics if available
-- 5. Compare efficiency metrics across different timeframes

    - Additional Notes: Query assumes that the NPI-to-state ratio is a valid efficiency metric, which may not hold true for all business models. Consider local market conditions and regulatory requirements when interpreting results. The operational scope categories (Single State/Regional/National) are arbitrary cutoffs that may need adjustment based on specific analysis needs.
