-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze the current state of initial Medicare provider enrollment applications
-- to support strategic planning, resource allocation, and process optimization
-- for CMS contractor review workflows

-- Query Insights:
-- 1. Provides a comprehensive view of pending Medicare provider enrollment applications
-- 2. Tracks weekly changes in application volumes
-- 3. Identifies patterns in provider name distributions

-- Limitations:
-- - Snapshot-based analysis limited to current pending applications
-- - No historical tracking of application progression
-- - Limited demographic insights

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic segmentation by state or region
-- 2. Track application age and processing time
-- 3. Correlate with provider type (physician/non-physician)
