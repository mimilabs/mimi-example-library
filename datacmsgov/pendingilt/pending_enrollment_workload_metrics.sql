-- Initial Provider Enrollment Workload Distribution Analysis 

-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyzes the distribution and volume of pending Medicare provider enrollment applications
-- to support workload planning, staff allocation, and processing optimization.
-- Key objectives:
-- 1. Measure current application volume and distribution
-- 2. Support resource allocation decisions
-- 3. Enable monitoring of contractor workload balance

WITH weekly_stats AS (
  -- Get the most recent weeks of data
  SELECT 
    _input_file_date as report_week,
    COUNT(*) as total_applications,
    COUNT(DISTINCT npi) as unique_providers,
    -- Calculate ratio of applications to providers
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT npi), 2) as apps_per_provider
  FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.pendingilt
  GROUP BY _input_file_date
),

provider_summary AS (
  -- Get current snapshot statistics
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) as current_pending,
    COUNT(DISTINCT npi) as distinct_providers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT last_name) as distinct_last_names,
    -- Calculate provider uniqueness metrics
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT npi) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as provider_uniqueness_pct
  FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.pendingilt
  WHERE _input_file_date = (SELECT MAX(_input_file_date) FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.pendingilt)
)

-- Combine weekly trends with current snapshot
SELECT 
  w.*,
  p.current_pending,
  p.distinct_providers,
  p.distinct_last_names,
  p.provider_uniqueness_pct
FROM weekly_stats w
CROSS JOIN provider_summary p
ORDER BY w.report_week DESC;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. weekly_stats CTE calculates key metrics by week
-- 2. provider_summary CTE gets current snapshot metrics
-- 3. Main query combines the CTEs to show trends and current state
-- 4. Results ordered by most recent week first

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Assumes _input_file_date represents complete weekly snapshots
-- - Does not account for application processing time
-- - Cannot identify resubmissions or corrections
-- - Limited to basic volume metrics without geographic or specialty detail

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic analysis using NPI registry data
-- 2. Include year-over-year comparisons
-- 3. Calculate moving averages for trend analysis
-- 4. Break out physician vs non-physician volumes
-- 5. Add contractor workload distribution metrics

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on operational metrics for enrollment processing capacity planning. Note that results are aggregated at weekly level and current snapshot, which may need adjustment based on actual reporting cycles. Consider local timezone settings when interpreting _input_file_date values.
