-- Provider Enrollment Application Volume Summary
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- Provides an executive summary of pending Medicare provider enrollment applications
-- to support operational oversight and capacity planning by showing:
-- 1. Total pending applications by month
-- 2. Rate of new applications vs. historical averages
-- 3. Key metrics for executive dashboards
--
-- This analysis supports healthcare executives in:
-- - Resource allocation decisions
-- - Enrollment processing capacity planning 
-- - Tracking provider network growth trends

  -- Get monthly application counts and compare to previous periods

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Groups applications by month to show volume trends
-- 2. Calculates completion rates and month-over-month changes
-- 3. Adds trend indicators for quick executive review
-- 4. Orders results with most recent month first

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes _input_file_date represents application submission date
-- - Requires at least 2 months of data for trend calculations
-- - Does not account for seasonal variations
-- - Missing last_name indicates incomplete application

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add rolling averages for longer-term trend analysis
-- 2. Include day-of-week patterns for staffing optimization
-- 3. Split analysis by provider type (using name patterns)
-- 4. Add geographical clustering based on NPI patterns
-- 5. Create projection models for future volume forecasting

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on month-over-month enrollment trends and completion rates. Requires at least 2 months of historical data for trend calculations. Performance may be impacted with very large datasets due to window functions. Consider partitioning by year if analyzing long time periods.
