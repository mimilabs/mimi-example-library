-- Medicare Beneficiary Navigation and Care Quality Assessment
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze how Medicare beneficiaries navigate the healthcare system and assess their 
-- perceived quality of care to identify areas for improving care coordination and 
-- patient experience.
--
-- This analysis helps healthcare organizations and policymakers:
-- 1. Understand barriers in healthcare navigation
-- 2. Evaluate quality of provider-patient communication
-- 3. Identify opportunities for improving care coordination
-- 4. Support development of patient-centered care initiatives

WITH patient_understanding AS (
  -- Get base metrics about patient comprehension and provider communication
  SELECT
    surveyyr,
    COUNT(*) as total_responses,
    
    -- Analyze Medicare program understanding
    SUM(CASE WHEN knw_knowmc IN ('1','2') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as easy_understand_medicare,

    SUM(CASE WHEN acw_doceasy IN ('3','4') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as clear_provider_communication,
    
    -- Care coordination indicators  
    SUM(CASE WHEN acw_drinfrmd IN ('3','4') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as good_care_coordination,
    
    -- Healthcare navigation assistance needs
    SUM(CASE WHEN acw_accompus = '1' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as needs_navigation_help

SELECT

  ROUND(100.0 * easy_understand_medicare / NULLIF(total_responses,0), 1) as pct_understand_medicare,
  ROUND(100.0 * clear_provider_communication / NULLIF(total_responses,0), 1) as pct_clear_communication,

ORDER BY surveyyr DESC;

-- How this works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to aggregate key metrics around understanding and navigation
-- 2. Calculates percentages in the main query to show trends over time
-- 3. Uses NULLIF to handle potential division by zero
-- 4. Focuses on survey years with complete data

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Assumes survey responses are representative of Medicare population
-- - Limited to specific survey questions about navigation and understanding
-- - Does not account for demographic or geographic variations
-- - May not capture all barriers to healthcare navigation

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add demographic breakdowns (age, gender, etc.)
-- 2. Include geographic analysis
-- 3. Analyze correlation with health outcomes
-- 4. Compare traditional Medicare vs Medicare Advantage
-- 5. Add confidence intervals for the percentages

    - Additional Notes: Query aggregates data annually and focuses on four key metrics: Medicare program understanding, provider communication clarity, care coordination effectiveness, and navigation assistance needs. Results are presented as percentages for easier trend analysis and benchmarking. Note that the metrics rely heavily on survey response data, which may have inherent biases or gaps.
