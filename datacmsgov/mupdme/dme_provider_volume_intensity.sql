-- DME Value Analysis by Patient Volume and Service Intensity
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- 1. Identify DME providers with high patient volumes and service intensity
-- 2. Calculate utilization metrics to understand provider efficiency
-- 3. Support network optimization and care delivery planning
-- 4. Enable data-driven decisions for patient access improvements

SELECT 
    r.rfrg_prvdr_state_abrvtn as state,
    r.rfrg_prvdr_spclty_desc as specialty,
    r.rbcs_lvl as equipment_category,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.rfrg_npi) as provider_count,
    SUM(r.tot_suplr_benes) as total_patients,
    SUM(r.tot_suplr_srvcs) as total_services,

    ROUND(SUM(r.tot_suplr_srvcs) * 1.0 / NULLIF(SUM(r.tot_suplr_benes), 0), 2) as svcs_per_patient,

FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.mupdme r
WHERE 
    -- Focus on most recent complete year
    r.mimi_src_file_date = '2022-12-31'
    -- Exclude records with suppressed beneficiary counts
    AND r.tot_suplr_benes >= 11
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
HAVING total_patients > 1000 -- Focus on providers with significant volume
ORDER BY total_patients DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Aggregates DME utilization data by state, specialty, and equipment category
-- 2. Calculates key metrics including patient volumes and service intensity
-- 3. Filters for significant provider volume to focus on meaningful patterns
-- 4. Provides a foundation for understanding DME service delivery patterns

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes 2022 data is most recent and complete
-- 2. Excludes providers with fewer than 11 beneficiaries due to data suppression
-- 3. Focus on high-volume providers may miss important niche services
-- 4. State-level aggregation may mask important local variations

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trend analysis
-- 2. Include rural/urban comparisons using ruca codes
-- 3. Break down equipment categories into specific HCPCS codes
-- 4. Add cost efficiency metrics comparing allowed vs paid amounts
-- 5. Incorporate geographic access analysis using zip codes

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on high-volume DME providers (>1000 patients) and their service intensity patterns. It excludes low-volume providers and those with suppressed beneficiary counts (<11). Results are limited to top 100 records by patient volume. Consider adjusting these thresholds based on specific analysis needs.
