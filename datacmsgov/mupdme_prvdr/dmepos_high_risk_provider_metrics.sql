-- dmepos_high_risk_benes_analysis.sql

-- Business Purpose:
-- - Analyze DMEPOS providers treating high-risk beneficiary populations
-- - Identify providers managing complex patients with above-average risk scores
-- - Support care management and resource allocation decisions
-- - Understand relationship between beneficiary risk and DMEPOS utilization

-- Main Query
SELECT
    -- Provider identification
    rfrg_prvdr_last_name_org AS provider_name,
    rfrg_prvdr_spclty_desc AS specialty,
    rfrg_prvdr_state_abrvtn AS state,

FROM mimi_ws_1.datacmsgov.mupdme_prvdr

-- Focus on most recent year and providers with significant volume
WHERE mimi_src_file_date = '2022-12-31'
AND tot_suplr_benes >= 20
AND bene_avg_risk_scre > 2.0  -- Focus on high-risk populations

-- Order by risk score to identify providers with highest-risk populations
ORDER BY bene_avg_risk_scre DESC
LIMIT 1000;

-- How This Query Works:
-- 1. Identifies DMEPOS providers treating beneficiaries with above-average risk scores
-- 2. Calculates key metrics around utilization, costs, and clinical conditions
-- 3. Focuses on providers with meaningful patient volumes (20+ beneficiaries)
-- 4. Provides context through demographic and dual-eligible metrics
-- 5. Orders results to highlight providers managing highest-risk populations

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Risk scores are valid indicators of patient complexity
-- - Minimum beneficiary threshold of 20 may exclude some specialized providers
-- - Analysis is limited to most recent year of data
-- - Does not account for regional variations in risk scoring
-- - Focuses only on Medicare FFS population

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trending of risk scores and costs
-- 2. Include geographic analysis of high-risk populations
-- 3. Break down by specific DMEPOS categories (DME vs POS vs Drug)
-- 4. Correlate with quality metrics or outcomes data
-- 5. Add peer group comparisons within specialties
-- 6. Analyze patterns of co-occurring chronic conditions

    - Additional Notes: Query identifies DMEPOS providers managing complex patient populations based on HCC risk scores and chronic condition prevalence. Minimum threshold of 20 beneficiaries and risk score >2.0 may need adjustment based on specific analysis needs. Payment calculations assume non-zero beneficiary counts.
