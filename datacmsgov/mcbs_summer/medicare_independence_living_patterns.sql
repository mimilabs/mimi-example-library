-- Medicare Beneficiary Functional Independence and Social Support Analysis
--
-- Business Purpose: This query analyzes daily living capabilities and social support structures 
-- of Medicare beneficiaries to:
-- 1. Identify populations at risk of losing independence
-- 2. Guide resource allocation for home support services
-- 3. Support care management program design
-- 4. Inform community support service planning

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Groups beneficiaries by survey year, living arrangement, and health status
-- 2. Calculates weighted population counts using survey weights
-- 3. Determines percentage of beneficiaries with ADL/IADL difficulties
-- 4. Presents results ordered by year and population size

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Relies on self-reported living arrangement and health status
-- - Survey weights may not fully adjust for non-response bias
-- - Missing values are excluded from analysis
-- - Does not account for changes in living arrangement over time

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic analysis by census region
-- 2. Include income level stratification
-- 3. Analyze trends over multiple years
-- 4. Incorporate service utilization metrics
-- 5. Add analysis of specific ADL/IADL limitations
-- 6. Include demographic breakdowns
-- 7. Add analysis of available caregiver support

    - Additional Notes: Query provides weighted analysis of beneficiary independence levels across different living arrangements. Uses survey weights (pufswgt) for population-level estimates. Best used for annual program planning and resource allocation rather than individual-level analysis due to aggregated nature of results.
