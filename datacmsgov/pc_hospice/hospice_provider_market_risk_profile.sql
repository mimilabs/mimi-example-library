/**
 * How the Query Works:
 * 1. Group hospice providers by state, organizational structure, and ownership type
 * 2. Calculate total providers and unique ownership entities
 * 3. Create market concentration and ownership consolidation segments
 * 4. Rank and display results with key financial risk indicators
 *
 * Assumptions and Limitations:
 * - Uses current Medicare enrollment data
 * - Assumes enrollment_id represents distinct provider locations
 * - Associate_id used as a proxy for ownership entities
 *
 * Potential Extensions:
 * - Add incorporation date analysis
 * - Include geographical coordinates for spatial analysis
 * - Integrate with Medicare claims data for revenue insights
 * - Compare with historical enrollment trends
