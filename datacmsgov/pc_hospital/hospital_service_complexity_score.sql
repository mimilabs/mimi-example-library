-- Hospital Subgroup Type Complexity Analysis
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- - Analyze hospitals based on number of specialized subgroup units they operate
-- - Identify facilities providing most comprehensive vs focused care models
-- - Support strategic analysis of market coverage and service capabilities
-- - Inform decisions about healthcare access and service line planning

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE that calculates a complexity score for each hospital based on specialized units
-- 2. Categorizes hospitals into complexity tiers based on their score
-- 3. Aggregates results by state and profit status to show distribution
-- 4. Includes percentage calculations to show relative market composition

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Treats all specialized units as equally important to complexity
-- - Doesn't account for size/scale of each unit
-- - May not capture all forms of specialization
-- - Focuses only on currently active Medicare-enrolled facilities

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add temporal analysis by incorporating incorporation_date
-- 2. Include geographic clustering analysis using city/zip
-- 3. Correlate complexity with ownership structures
-- 4. Add population demographics to identify service gaps
-- 5. Compare complexity patterns between urban/rural areas

    - Additional Notes: This analysis tracks hospital service complexity through a scoring system based on specialized units. The score ranges from 0-6, with higher scores indicating more diverse service offerings. The query is particularly useful for identifying full-service hospitals vs specialized facilities, and understanding the distribution of comprehensive care capabilities across different states and ownership types. Note that the complexity score weights all specialties equally, which may not reflect true operational complexity or resource requirements.
