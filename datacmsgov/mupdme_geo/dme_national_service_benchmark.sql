-- Business Purpose:
-- - Benchmark national-level Medicare Durable Medical Equipment (DME) spending and utilization
-- - Compare total service volume, Medicare payments, and cost efficiency across equipment categories
-- - Support strategic planning for DME service line management and cost containment initiatives

-- Query Mechanics:
-- 1. Aggregates national-level DME service metrics
-- 2. Calculates spending efficiency across service categories
-- 3. Provides comprehensive view of DME service utilization and cost

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses single year of data (specified by mimi_src_file_date)
-- - Relies on national-level aggregation
-- - Limited to Medicare fee-for-service data

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year comparison
-- 2. Include geographic variation analysis
-- 3. Integrate with beneficiary demographic data
