-- dme_high_impact_services.sql

-- Business Purpose:
-- - Identify DME services with highest total cost and beneficiary impact per state
-- - Support value-based care initiatives by highlighting critical DME services
-- - Enable targeted cost management and quality improvement programs
-- - Inform strategic planning and resource allocation decisions

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Aggregates key utilization and spending metrics by state and HCPCS code
-- 2. Calculates per-beneficiary spending to assess service intensity
-- 3. Ranks services within each state by total Medicare spend
-- 4. Returns top 5 highest-impact services for each state

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses most recent year's data (2022)
-- - Excludes suppressed beneficiary counts (<11)
-- - Impact measured primarily through financial metrics
-- - Does not account for clinical outcomes or quality measures
-- - State-level analysis may mask local variations

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trend analysis for high-impact services
-- 2. Include additional metrics like supplier concentration
-- 3. Compare high-impact services across regions or demographics
-- 4. Incorporate clinical quality or outcomes data
-- 5. Add filters for specific equipment categories or price thresholds

    - Additional Notes: Query identifies top 5 DME services by Medicare spend for each state, with per-beneficiary cost metrics. Focuses on services with minimum 11 beneficiaries for privacy compliance. Results can be used to prioritize cost management initiatives and resource allocation across states.
