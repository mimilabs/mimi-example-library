-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze pharmaceutical innovation and prescription trends by identifying 
-- emerging drugs and tracking their adoption across different provider types
-- Key insights for:
-- 1. Pharmaceutical market research
-- 2. Healthcare provider prescribing pattern analysis
-- 3. Emerging treatment trend identification

-- Query Mechanics:
-- 1. Aggregates prescription data by brand/generic name and provider type
-- 2. Calculates key metrics like total claims, drug cost, and average cost per claim
-- 3. Categorizes drug adoption tiers based on total claims
-- 4. Ranks drugs within each provider type by claims and total cost

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Uses most recent available data
-- - Filters out low-volume prescriptions (< 10 claims)
-- - Provides snapshot of current prescription trends
-- - Does not include patient-specific or longitudinal analysis

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic analysis by incorporating state-level metrics
-- 2. Compare year-over-year drug adoption trends
-- 3. Integrate with additional provider specialty classification data
-- 4. Analyze cost variations across different drug classes
