/*
Business Purpose:
Analyze Medicare provider network dynamics through revalidation lens, 
identifying network composition, upcoming revalidation clusters, 
and potential provider mobility/reassignment patterns.

Key Business Insights:
- Understand geographic distribution of provider revalidations
- Identify potential network disruption risks
- Support strategic provider network planning

/*
How the Query Works:
1. Creates a summary of revalidation data by state and record type
2. Aggregates specialty distribution across providers
3. Joins summaries to provide comprehensive network insights

Assumptions:
- Data represents current Medicare provider landscape
- 'TBD' dates indicate pending revalidation assignments
- Assumes data completeness and accuracy

Potential Extensions:
- Add time-series analysis of revalidation trends
- Incorporate provider age/experience dimensions
- Develop predictive models for network changes
- Create geographic heat maps of provider mobility

Recommended Next Steps:
- Validate results against source data
- Cross-reference with provider credentialing databases
- Develop interactive dashboard for stakeholders
