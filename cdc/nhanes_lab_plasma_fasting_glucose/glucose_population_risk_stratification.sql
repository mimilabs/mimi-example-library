-- Title: NHANES Fasting Glucose Demographic Health Risk Stratification

/* 
Business Purpose:
- Develop a concise population health risk assessment framework using fasting glucose measurements
- Identify potential high-risk demographic segments for targeted healthcare interventions
- Provide actionable insights for public health policy and preventive care strategies

Key Strategic Objectives:
- Quantify diabetes risk across different population subgroups
- Support precision population health management
- Enable data-driven healthcare resource allocation

/*
Query Mechanics:
- First CTE creates risk categories based on standard clinical glucose thresholds
- Second CTE generates summary statistics with population weighting
- Final SELECT provides comprehensive risk stratification overview

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Uses standard clinical glucose thresholds (Normal: <100, Prediabetes: 100-125, Diabetes Risk: >=126)
- Relies on NHANES survey sampling weights for population estimates
- Snapshot represents survey period, not current real-time population health

Potential Extensions:
1. Add age/gender stratification 
2. Incorporate additional metabolic risk factors
3. Create time-series tracking of risk category shifts
