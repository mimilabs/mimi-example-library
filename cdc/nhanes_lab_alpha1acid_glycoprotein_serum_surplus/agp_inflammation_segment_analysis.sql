-- agp_demographic_inflammation_insights.sql
-- 
-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze Alpha-1-Acid Glycoprotein (AGP) levels across different demographic segments
-- to understand potential inflammation markers and population health variations.
-- This analysis provides insights for healthcare researchers, epidemiologists, 
-- and public health strategists interested in understanding population-level inflammation profiles.

-- Query Mechanics:
-- 1. Uses Common Table Expression (CTE) to segment and analyze AGP levels
-- 2. Categorizes samples by weight to understand representativeness
-- 3. Calculates descriptive statistics and percentile information
-- 4. Includes coefficient of variation to highlight variability

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes sample weights are meaningful for population representation
-- - Relies on complete and accurate AGP measurements
-- - Limited by NHANES sampling methodology

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Add time-based analysis using mimi_src_file_date
-- 2. Integrate with demographic tables for more detailed insights
-- 3. Create predictive models for inflammation risk

-- Recommended Next Steps:
-- - Validate findings with clinical experts
-- - Cross-reference with other inflammation markers
-- - Develop population health strategies based on insights
