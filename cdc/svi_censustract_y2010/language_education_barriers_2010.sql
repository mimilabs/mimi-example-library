-- Title: Language Barriers and Educational Gaps in Census Tracts (2010)
-- 
-- Business Purpose:
-- This query analyzes census tracts to identify areas where limited English proficiency 
-- intersects with lower educational attainment. Understanding these overlapping challenges
-- helps healthcare organizations and community services:
-- - Target bilingual outreach programs
-- - Develop appropriate health literacy materials
-- - Allocate language assistance resources efficiently
-- - Plan educational support services

SELECT 
    -- Location identifiers
    state_name,
    county,
    tract,
    location,
    
    -- Core metrics rounded for clarity
    ROUND(e_p_limeng * 100, 1) as pct_limited_english,
    ROUND(e_p_nohsdip * 100, 1) as pct_no_highschool,
    
    -- Population context
    totpop as total_population,
    
    -- Calculate estimated affected population
    ROUND(e_limeng) as est_limited_english_speakers,
    ROUND(e_nohsdip) as est_no_highschool_diploma,
    
    -- Flag high-risk areas (90th percentile)
    f_pl_limeng as is_high_limited_english,
    f_pl_nohsdip as is_high_no_diploma

FROM mimi_ws_1.cdc.svi_censustract_y2010

-- Focus on areas with meaningful population
WHERE totpop >= 100

-- Identify tracts with both language and education challenges
  AND (e_p_limeng > 0.05 OR e_p_nohsdip > 0.15)

-- Order by states and counties for easier regional analysis
ORDER BY 
    state_name,
    county,
    pct_limited_english DESC,
    pct_no_highschool DESC;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Selects key geographic identifiers and core metrics
-- 2. Calculates percentages for limited English and no high school diploma
-- 3. Includes population counts to understand scale of impact
-- 4. Filters for meaningful population size and relevant threshold levels
-- 5. Orders results geographically and by severity of challenges

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes census tract population >= 100 for statistical relevance
-- - Uses 5% limited English and 15% no diploma as minimum thresholds
-- - Based on 2010 data; conditions may have changed
-- - Margin of error (MOE) not incorporated in this basic analysis

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add temporal analysis by comparing to more recent years
-- 2. Include margin of error calculations for more precise estimates
-- 3. Correlate with healthcare utilization or outcome data
-- 4. Add spatial clustering analysis to identify regional patterns
-- 5. Include demographic factors like age distribution or poverty levels

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on dual risk factors of limited English proficiency and educational attainment, using 5% and 15% thresholds respectively. Results exclude tracts with population below 100 to ensure statistical relevance. Geographic ordering enables regional pattern identification.
