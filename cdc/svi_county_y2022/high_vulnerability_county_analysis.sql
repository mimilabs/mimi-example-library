-- Query Explanation:
-- 1. Identifies counties in the top 10% of national social vulnerability
-- 2. Calculates key socioeconomic and demographic vulnerability indicators
-- 3. Provides a ranked view of the most vulnerable counties

-- Assumptions:
-- - Uses 2022 CDC Social Vulnerability Index data
-- - Percentile ranking (rpl_themes) determines vulnerability
-- - Top 10% of counties represent high-risk areas

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Add geospatial analysis by state or region
-- 2. Include additional demographic breakdowns
-- 3. Compare year-over-year vulnerability changes
-- 4. Integrate with emergency resource allocation models
