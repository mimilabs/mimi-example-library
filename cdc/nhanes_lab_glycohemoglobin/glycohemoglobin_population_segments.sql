-- Population Health Segmentation Based on Glycohemoglobin Ranges
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- This query segments the population based on glycohemoglobin levels to identify 
-- distinct health groups for targeted interventions and resource allocation.
-- The analysis supports population health management strategies and helps
-- healthcare organizations prioritize outreach efforts.

WITH glyco_segments AS (
  SELECT
    -- Create meaningful segments based on clinical guidelines
    CASE 
      WHEN lbxgh < 5.7 THEN 'Normal'
      WHEN lbxgh >= 5.7 AND lbxgh < 6.5 THEN 'Pre-diabetic'
      WHEN lbxgh >= 6.5 AND lbxgh < 8.0 THEN 'Controlled Diabetic'
      WHEN lbxgh >= 8.0 THEN 'Uncontrolled Diabetic'
      ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS health_segment,

    COUNT(*) as segment_population,
    
    -- Calculate key statistics for each segment
    ROUND(AVG(lbxgh), 2) as avg_glycohemoglobin,
    ROUND(MIN(lbxgh), 2) as min_glycohemoglobin,
    ROUND(MAX(lbxgh), 2) as max_glycohemoglobin
  FROM mimi_ws_1.cdc.nhanes_lab_glycohemoglobin

      WHEN lbxgh >= 5.7 AND lbxgh < 6.5 THEN 'Pre-diabetic'
      WHEN lbxgh >= 6.5 AND lbxgh < 8.0 THEN 'Controlled Diabetic'
      WHEN lbxgh >= 8.0 THEN 'Uncontrolled Diabetic'

FROM glyco_segments
ORDER BY 
  CASE health_segment
    WHEN 'Normal' THEN 1

    WHEN 'Controlled Diabetic' THEN 3
    WHEN 'Uncontrolled Diabetic' THEN 4

  END;

-- How it works:
-- 1. Creates segments based on clinical glycohemoglobin thresholds
-- 2. Calculates population counts and basic statistics for each segment
-- 3. Computes percentage distribution across segments
-- 4. Orders results in clinically meaningful sequence

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes glycohemoglobin values are accurately recorded
-- - Segments based on standard clinical thresholds
-- - Does not account for demographic factors
-- - Does not consider temporal changes in population distribution

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add temporal analysis to track segment changes over time
-- 2. Include cost modeling based on segment populations
-- 3. Add risk stratification within segments
-- 4. Incorporate demographic analysis if available
-- 5. Compare segment distributions across different regions or populations

    - Additional Notes: Query classifies population into four clinically relevant segments based on glycohemoglobin levels (Normal, Pre-diabetic, Controlled Diabetic, Uncontrolled Diabetic) and provides distribution statistics. The thresholds used align with standard clinical guidelines for diabetes diagnosis and monitoring.
