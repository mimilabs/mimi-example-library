-- nhanes_medication_coverage.sql

-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyzes medication and prescription drug-related variables in NHANES metadata to:
-- - Identify available medication usage and prescription drug data
-- - Support pharmaceutical market research and adherence studies
-- - Enable analysis of medication patterns across demographics
-- This helps healthcare organizations and pharma companies understand:
-- - Available medication data for market analysis
-- - Prescription drug coverage across survey years
-- - Opportunities for medication adherence research

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Filters metadata for medication/prescription related variables using pattern matching
-- 2. Excludes drug screening/testing variables to focus on therapeutic use
-- 3. Adds context by showing number of variables per data file
-- 4. Orders results chronologically and by data file for easy review

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Pattern matching may miss some medication variables with unique descriptions
-- - Limited to explicit medication/prescription mentions in descriptions
-- - Recent years only (2015+) - modify begin_year filter to expand coverage
-- - Does not capture medication dosage or frequency details unless in description

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add categorization of medications by therapeutic class
-- 2. Cross-reference with demographic variables for population analysis
-- 3. Include specific medication names or NDC codes if available
-- 4. Expand to include related health condition variables
-- 5. Add temporal analysis of medication variable coverage trends
-- 6. Link to specific disease or condition management variables

    - Additional Notes: Query specifically targets medication and prescription drug variables in NHANES metadata from 2015 onwards. Pattern matching approach may need adjustment based on specific medication categories of interest. Consider medication naming conventions and therapeutic classifications when interpreting results.
