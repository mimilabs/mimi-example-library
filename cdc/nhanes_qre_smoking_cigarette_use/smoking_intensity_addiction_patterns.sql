-- Title: NHANES Smoking Intensity and Addiction Pattern Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- This query analyzes smoking intensity and addiction patterns to:
-- 1. Identify high-risk populations based on cigarettes per day and time to first cigarette
-- 2. Assess smoking dependency levels for public health intervention planning
-- 3. Support targeted cessation program design
-- 4. Guide resource allocation for nicotine addiction treatment

SELECT 
    -- Categorize time to first cigarette as addiction severity indicator
    CASE 
        WHEN smq07_ = 1 THEN 'Within 5 minutes'
        WHEN smq07_ = 2 THEN '6-30 minutes'
        WHEN smq07_ = 3 THEN '31-60 minutes'
        WHEN smq07_ = 4 THEN 'After 60 minutes'
        ELSE 'Not specified'
    END AS time_to_first_cigarette,

    -- Create smoking intensity categories
    CASE 
        WHEN smd650 < 10 THEN 'Light (< 10/day)'
        WHEN smd650 BETWEEN 10 AND 20 THEN 'Moderate (10-20/day)'
        WHEN smd650 > 20 THEN 'Heavy (> 20/day)'
        ELSE 'Not specified'
    END AS smoking_intensity,

    -- Calculate summary statistics
    COUNT(*) as population_count,
    AVG(CAST(smd650 AS FLOAT)) as avg_cigarettes_per_day,
    AVG(CAST(smd641 AS FLOAT)) as avg_smoking_days_per_month,

    -- Calculate percentage for each category
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage_in_category

    -- Focus on current smokers with valid responses

    AND smd650 IS NOT NULL -- Valid cigarettes per day
    AND smq07_ IS NOT NULL -- Valid time to first cigarette

        WHEN smq07_ = 1 THEN 'Within 5 minutes'
        WHEN smq07_ = 2 THEN '6-30 minutes'

    END
ORDER BY

    smoking_intensity;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Identifies current smokers using smq040
-- 2. Categorizes smoking intensity based on cigarettes per day (smd650)
-- 3. Classifies addiction severity using time to first cigarette (smq07_)
-- 4. Calculates population counts and percentages for each category
-- 5. Provides average cigarettes per day and smoking days per month

-- Assumptions and limitations:
-- 1. Assumes current smokers are accurately self-reporting
-- 2. Limited to respondents with valid responses for key metrics
-- 3. Does not account for seasonal variations in smoking patterns
-- 4. Cross-sectional nature limits longitudinal insights

-- Possible extensions:
-- 1. Add demographic breakdowns (age, gender, socioeconomic status)
-- 2. Include brand preferences and nicotine content correlation
-- 3. Analyze relationship with quit attempts and success rates
-- 4. Incorporate e-cigarette dual use patterns
-- 5. Add temporal trends across survey cycles

    - Additional Notes: Query calculates key addiction metrics based on the Fagerstr√∂m Test criteria (time to first cigarette and cigarettes per day). Results can be used to estimate nicotine dependence levels in the population and identify high-risk groups for targeted interventions. Consider joining with demographic tables for more detailed analysis.
