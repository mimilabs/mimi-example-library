-- Title: Population Glucose Tolerance Segmentation Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- Stratify the population based on oral glucose tolerance test results
-- Provide insights into metabolic health distribution
-- Support population health management and targeted intervention strategies

WITH glucose_tolerance_segments AS (
    -- Categorize glucose levels into clinically meaningful segments
    SELECT 
        seqn,
        wtsog2yr AS population_weight,
        lbxglt AS glucose_level_mg_dl,
        
        -- Categorize glucose tolerance based on standard clinical thresholds
        CASE 
            WHEN lbxglt < 140 THEN 'Normal'
            WHEN lbxglt BETWEEN 140 AND 199 THEN 'Prediabetes'
            WHEN lbxglt >= 200 THEN 'Diabetes'
        END AS glucose_tolerance_status,
        
        -- Segment additional context about test conditions

    FROM mimi_ws_1.cdc.nhanes_lab_oral_glucose_tolerance_test

segment_distribution AS (
    -- Compute population distribution across glucose tolerance segments
    SELECT 
        glucose_tolerance_status,
        COUNT(*) AS segment_count,
        ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) AS segment_percentage,
        ROUND(SUM(population_weight), 2) AS weighted_population_estimate,
        ROUND(AVG(glucose_level_mg_dl), 2) AS avg_glucose_level,
        ROUND(AVG(fasting_hours), 2) AS avg_fasting_duration
    
    FROM glucose_tolerance_segments
    GROUP BY glucose_tolerance_status
)

-- Primary analysis query presenting metabolic health insights
SELECT 
    glucose_tolerance_status,
    segment_count,
    segment_percentage,
    weighted_population_estimate,
    avg_glucose_level,
    avg_fasting_duration
FROM segment_distribution
ORDER BY segment_percentage DESC;

-- Query Mechanics:
-- 1. First CTE: Categorizes individual test results into clinical segments
-- 2. Second CTE: Computes population-level statistics for each segment
-- 3. Final query presents summarized metabolic health distribution

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses standard clinical thresholds for glucose tolerance classification
-- - Relies on 2-hour post-challenge glucose measurement
-- - Population weights provide estimated national representation
-- - Cross-sectional data snapshot, not longitudinal tracking

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add demographic stratification (age, gender, ethnicity)
-- 2. Incorporate additional metabolic risk markers
-- 3. Compare different survey cycle data for trend analysis

    - Additional Notes: Uses NHANES OGTT data to provide metabolic health segmentation. Requires careful interpretation due to cross-sectional nature of survey data and standard clinical thresholds applied.
