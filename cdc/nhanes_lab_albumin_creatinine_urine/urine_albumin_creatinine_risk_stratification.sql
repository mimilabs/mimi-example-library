-- Business Purpose: Develop a strategic population health segmentation analysis 
-- that reveals nuanced patterns in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios across 
-- different population subgroups, enabling targeted healthcare interventions 
-- and personalized risk assessment strategies.

/* 
Query Mechanics:
- Creates risk categories based on albumin-to-creatinine ratio
- Calculates key statistical metrics for each risk segment
- Provides percentage distribution across population

Analytical Assumptions:
- Uses standard clinical thresholds for risk categorization
- Assumes data represents a representative population sample
- Focuses on complete and valid albumin-creatinine measurements

Potential Extensions:
1. Incorporate demographic segmentation (age, gender)
2. Add temporal trend analysis across survey cycles
3. Integrate with other health indicator datasets
4. Create predictive risk models using machine learning techniques

Business Value:
- Enables population health management strategies
- Supports early intervention and preventive care planning
- Provides insights for targeted healthcare resource allocation

    - Additional Notes: Query segments population health risk based on albumin-to-creatinine ratio using NHANES data. Requires clean, complete dataset with valid measurements. Best used as a population-level screening and preliminary risk assessment tool.
