-- Title: Aging Population Vulnerability and Resource Planning Analysis 2016

-- Business Purpose:
-- This analysis identifies counties with high concentrations of elderly populations (65+) 
-- combined with socioeconomic challenges to:
-- 1. Support healthcare resource allocation and senior services planning
-- 2. Identify areas needing enhanced support services for aging populations
-- 3. Guide preventive healthcare and community support program investments

SELECT 
    state,
    county,
    -- Population statistics
    e_totpop as total_population,
    e_age65 as elderly_population,
    ROUND(ep_age65, 1) as elderly_percentage,
    
    -- Key vulnerability indicators
    ROUND(ep_pov, 1) as poverty_rate,
    ROUND(ep_disabl, 1) as disability_rate,
    ROUND(ep_uninsur, 1) as uninsured_rate,
    
    -- Housing and transportation challenges
    ROUND(ep_noveh, 1) as no_vehicle_rate,
    ROUND(ep_mobile, 1) as mobile_home_rate,
    
    -- Overall vulnerability scores
    ROUND(rpl_theme1, 2) as socioeconomic_vulnerability,
    ROUND(rpl_theme2, 2) as household_composition_vulnerability,
    ROUND(rpl_themes, 2) as overall_vulnerability

FROM mimi_ws_1.cdc.svi_county_y2016

-- Filter for counties with significant elderly populations
WHERE ep_age65 >= 20  -- Counties where 20%+ of population is 65+
AND e_totpop >= 10000 -- Focus on counties with meaningful population size

-- Order by overall vulnerability and elderly percentage
ORDER BY rpl_themes DESC, ep_age65 DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- How it works:
-- 1. Selects key demographic and vulnerability metrics for counties
-- 2. Focuses on counties with high elderly population percentages
-- 3. Includes relevant social and economic risk factors
-- 4. Orders results to highlight most vulnerable areas with large elderly populations

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - 20% elderly threshold is somewhat arbitrary and can be adjusted
-- - Population minimum of 10,000 excludes very small counties
-- - Data is from 2016 and may not reflect current conditions
-- - County-level analysis may mask neighborhood-level variations

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic clustering analysis to identify regional patterns
-- 2. Compare with healthcare facility availability data
-- 3. Incorporate seasonal population variations in retirement destinations
-- 4. Add trend analysis by comparing with other years
-- 5. Include Medicare/Medicaid utilization data if available

    - Additional Notes: Query identifies counties with high elderly populations (20%+) and significant social vulnerability factors, helping target senior services and healthcare resource planning. Minimum population threshold of 10,000 ensures focus on statistically significant communities.
