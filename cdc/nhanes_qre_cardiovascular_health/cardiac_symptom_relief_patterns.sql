-- Cardiac Symptom Relief Pattern Analysis
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze how quickly patients find relief from cardiac symptoms to identify
-- potential high-risk populations and inform emergency response protocols.
-- This insight helps healthcare providers develop targeted intervention strategies
-- and patient education programs.

WITH symptom_relief_summary AS (
    -- Get base population with chest pain
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) as total_respondents,
        SUM(CASE WHEN cdq001 = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as chest_pain_positive,
        SUM(CASE WHEN cdq005 = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as pain_relieved_by_rest,
        SUM(CASE WHEN cdq006 = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as relief_under_10min,
        SUM(CASE WHEN cdq006 = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as relief_10min_plus
    FROM mimi_ws_1.cdc.nhanes_qre_cardiovascular_health
    WHERE cdq001 IS NOT NULL
),

    SELECT

        ROUND(100.0 * chest_pain_positive / total_respondents, 1) as chest_pain_pct,
        ROUND(100.0 * pain_relieved_by_rest / NULLIF(chest_pain_positive, 0), 1) as relief_by_rest_pct,
        ROUND(100.0 * relief_under_10min / NULLIF(pain_relieved_by_rest, 0), 1) as quick_relief_pct

SELECT 
    total_respondents,

    END as clinical_interpretation
FROM relief_metrics;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. First CTE establishes baseline population and counts for key symptoms
-- 2. Second CTE calculates relevant percentages
-- 3. Final select adds clinical interpretation
--
-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes null values should be excluded from calculations
-- - Relief time is self-reported and subjective
-- - Does not account for potential seasonal variations
-- - Limited to binary yes/no responses
--
-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add demographic breakdowns (if linked to demographic data)
-- 2. Include trend analysis across multiple survey periods
-- 3. Cross-reference with medication usage patterns
-- 4. Add geographic analysis for regional variations
-- 5. Incorporate risk stratification based on relief patterns

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on measuring and categorizing the speed of symptom relief among chest pain patients, which is a key indicator for risk assessment and emergency care protocols. The clinical interpretation categorization could be adjusted based on specific institutional guidelines.
