-- Business Purpose:
-- - Explore correlations between HDL cholesterol levels and key demographic segments
-- - Provide insights for targeted healthcare interventions and personalized risk assessment
-- - Support population health management strategies by understanding HDL variations

-- Query Mechanics:
-- 1. Categorizes HDL cholesterol levels into clinically relevant segments
-- 2. Calculates patient distribution across HDL categories
-- 3. Provides summary statistics for each category
-- 4. Enables quick visual understanding of population HDL health

-- Key Assumptions:
-- - Uses standard clinical thresholds for HDL categorization
-- - Assumes data represents a representative population sample
-- - Focuses on direct HDL measurements in mg/dL

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Add age group stratification
-- 2. Correlate with other health metrics (BMI, blood pressure)
-- 3. Trend analysis across multiple survey periods

    - Additional Notes: The query segments HDL cholesterol data into clinically relevant categories, providing population-level insights. Important to note this uses standard medical thresholds and requires careful interpretation within specific demographic contexts.
