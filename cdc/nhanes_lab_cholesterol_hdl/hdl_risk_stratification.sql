-- hdl_cholesterol_risk_segmentation.sql
--
-- Business Purpose:
-- - Segment patient population into HDL cholesterol risk categories based on clinical guidelines
-- - Enable targeted intervention strategies for different risk groups
-- - Support population health management and resource allocation decisions
-- - Guide preventive care initiatives based on risk stratification

-- Main Query

      WHEN lbdhdd BETWEEN 40 AND 59 THEN 'Moderate Risk'

-- How it works:
-- 1. Creates risk segments based on clinical HDL guidelines
-- 2. Calculates key metrics for each segment including patient counts and averages
-- 3. Computes percentage distribution across risk categories
-- 4. Orders results by risk severity for easy interpretation

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Risk categories based on standard clinical guidelines but may need adjustment
-- - Assumes data quality and completeness in source measurements
-- - Does not account for other cardiovascular risk factors
-- - Point-in-time analysis that may need periodic updates

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add demographic breakdowns within risk categories
-- 2. Include temporal trending of risk distributions
-- 3. Incorporate additional lab values for comprehensive risk assessment
-- 4. Add statistical significance testing between groups
-- 5. Create visualization-ready output for dashboard integration

    - Additional Notes: Query defines HDL risk categories using standard clinical thresholds (<40 mg/dL: High Risk, 40-59 mg/dL: Moderate Risk, â‰¥60 mg/dL: Optimal). Results include population distribution and average HDL levels per risk category. Best used for initial population health screening and resource allocation planning.
