/* find_most_common_cholesterol_values.sql

Business Purpose:
This query identifies the most common total cholesterol values and their frequencies
in the NHANES dataset. Understanding the typical cholesterol patterns helps:
- Healthcare providers establish better baseline expectations
- Medical device manufacturers calibrate testing equipment ranges
- Pharmaceutical companies target drug development efforts
- Insurance companies refine risk assessment models

The analysis focuses on mg/dL values for compatibility with US medical standards.

/* How this query works:
1. First CTE groups cholesterol readings and calculates frequencies
2. Second CTE adds ranking to identify most common values
3. Final output shows top 20 values with their distribution metrics

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Assumes NULL values should be excluded
- Focuses on mg/dL values only (not mmol/L)
- Does not account for potential measurement rounding differences
- Limited to frequency analysis without demographic context

Possible Extensions:
1. Add year-over-year trend analysis of common values
2. Segment by data source file to identify collection patterns
3. Compare distribution across different ranges (normal/borderline/high)
4. Add statistical measures (mean, median, mode) for context
5. Create value bands/buckets for broader pattern analysis

    - Additional Notes: Query provides frequency distribution of cholesterol values but assumes uniform rounding practices across data collection periods. Consider adding rounding standardization for more accurate comparisons across different measurement equipment and collection methods.
