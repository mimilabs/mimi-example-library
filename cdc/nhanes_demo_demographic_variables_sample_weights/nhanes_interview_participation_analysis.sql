-- Query Mechanics:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to segment participants by demographics and interview characteristics
-- 2. Calculates weighted participation rates to account for survey sampling design
-- 3. Provides a comprehensive view of interview participation factors

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes interview weights accurately represent population sampling
-- - Limited to available demographic and interview metadata
-- - Does not account for longitudinal changes in survey methodology

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic region analysis
-- 2. Compare participation rates across different survey cycles
-- 3. Incorporate additional interview quality indicators
-- 4. Develop predictive models for participation likelihood
