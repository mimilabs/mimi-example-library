-- nhanes_family_composition_trends.sql

-- Business Purpose: 
-- Analyze household and family composition trends across different demographic groups to identify:
-- 1. Multi-generational households and caregiving needs
-- 2. Household size variations by income level
-- 3. Family structure patterns that may impact healthcare access and delivery
-- This information helps healthcare organizations better understand family dynamics when designing
-- programs and allocating resources for family-centered care initiatives.

-- Query Operation:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to calculate key family composition metrics from raw data
-- 2. Categorizes income levels using poverty-income ratio
-- 3. Applies survey weights for population-representative estimates
-- 4. Aggregates metrics by survey cycle and income category
-- 5. Calculates percentage of multi-generational households

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes survey weights are properly calibrated for family-level analysis
-- 2. Missing values in household composition fields are treated as zeros
-- 3. Multi-generational definition is simplified to presence of young children and seniors
-- 4. Income categories are based on standard poverty level multipliers

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic analysis if location data is available
-- 2. Include education level of household reference person
-- 3. Analyze trends in single-parent households
-- 4. Compare family composition patterns across different racial/ethnic groups
-- 5. Incorporate marital status analysis for household reference person

    - Additional Notes: Query aggregates household composition data weighted by survey design, making it suitable for population-level demographic research. Incorporates income stratification for analyzing socioeconomic patterns in family structures. Results should be interpreted with consideration for survey sampling methodology and weighting schemes.
