-- Language Barrier and Minority Status Impact Analysis - 2016
--
-- Business Purpose: 
-- This analysis identifies census tracts where language barriers intersect with minority status,
-- helping healthcare organizations and social services better plan for multilingual services,
-- cultural competency training, and targeted community outreach programs.
-- The insights can guide resource allocation for translation services, multicultural healthcare
-- providers, and culturally appropriate health education materials.

SELECT

FROM mimi_ws_1.cdc.svi_censustract_y2016

-- Focus on areas with significant language barriers
WHERE ep_limeng >= 5.0
  AND e_totpop >= 100  -- Exclude very small populations

-- Order by most impacted areas
ORDER BY ep_limeng DESC, ep_minrty DESC
LIMIT 1000;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Identifies census tracts with meaningful limited English proficiency (>= 5%)
-- 2. Combines language barriers with minority population metrics
-- 3. Includes relevant percentile rankings and flag indicators
-- 4. Adds uninsured percentage for healthcare access context
-- 5. Filters out very small populations to ensure statistical relevance
--
-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses 5% threshold for limited English as meaningful barrier
-- - Based on 2012-2016 ACS estimates
-- - Does not specify which languages are most prevalent
-- - Does not account for bilingual resources already in place
--
-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic clustering to identify regional patterns
-- 2. Break down by specific age groups to target interventions
-- 3. Include poverty and education metrics for fuller context
-- 4. Compare against local healthcare provider language capabilities
-- 5. Track changes over multiple years where data available

    - Additional Notes: Query analyzes intersections of language barriers and minority status at census tract level, with 5% minimum threshold for limited English proficiency. Includes uninsured rates for healthcare context and filters out tracts with populations under 100 to ensure statistical validity.
