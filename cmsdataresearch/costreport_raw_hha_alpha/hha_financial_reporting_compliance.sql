-- hha_financial_statement_analysis.sql

-- Business Purpose: This query analyzes Home Health Agencies' balance sheet positions
-- and key financial indicators by extracting values from Worksheet G (Balance Sheet).
-- Understanding financial health and stability helps identify industry trends and risks.

WITH balance_sheet_data AS (
    -- Filter for balance sheet entries from Worksheet G
    SELECT 
        rpt_rec_num,
        line_num,
        clmn_num,
        itm_alphnmrc_itm_txt,
        mimi_src_file_date
    FROM mimi_ws_1.cmsdataresearch.costreport_raw_hha_alpha
    WHERE wksht_cd = 'G' 
    AND line_num IN ('1', '10', '30', '60') -- Key balance sheet lines
    AND clmn_num = '1' -- Column 1 typically contains current year values
    AND itm_alphnmrc_itm_txt IS NOT NULL
),

yearly_metrics AS (
    -- Calculate key financial metrics by report and year
    SELECT 
        YEAR(mimi_src_file_date) as report_year,
        COUNT(DISTINCT rpt_rec_num) as num_agencies,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN line_num = '1' THEN rpt_rec_num END) as agencies_with_cash,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN line_num = '30' THEN rpt_rec_num END) as agencies_with_liabilities,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN line_num = '60' THEN rpt_rec_num END) as agencies_with_equity
    FROM balance_sheet_data
    GROUP BY YEAR(mimi_src_file_date)

-- Final output with financial reporting completeness trends
SELECT 
    report_year,
    num_agencies,
    agencies_with_cash,
    agencies_with_liabilities,
    agencies_with_equity,
    ROUND(agencies_with_cash * 100.0 / num_agencies, 1) as pct_reporting_cash,
    ROUND(agencies_with_liabilities * 100.0 / num_agencies, 1) as pct_reporting_liabilities,
    ROUND(agencies_with_equity * 100.0 / num_agencies, 1) as pct_reporting_equity
FROM yearly_metrics
ORDER BY report_year DESC;

-- How it works:
-- 1. First CTE extracts relevant balance sheet entries from Worksheet G
-- 2. Second CTE aggregates data by year to show reporting completeness
-- 3. Final query calculates percentage metrics and presents trends

-- Assumptions:
-- 1. Worksheet G contains standardized balance sheet information
-- 2. Column 1 represents current year values
-- 3. Key line items (1,10,30,60) represent main financial categories
-- 4. mimi_src_file_date is a reliable proxy for reporting period

-- Limitations:
-- 1. Does not analyze actual dollar values (would need numeric table)
-- 2. Cannot identify specific reporting issues/gaps
-- 3. Limited to basic balance sheet structure analysis

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add trending analysis across multiple years
-- 2. Include more detailed balance sheet line items
-- 3. Cross-reference with other worksheets for validation
-- 4. Add geographical or ownership type dimensions
-- 5. Compare with industry benchmarks if available

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on measuring reporting completeness rather than financial performance itself. It tracks whether agencies are submitting key balance sheet components, which serves as a proxy for reporting compliance and data quality. This approach is particularly useful for initial data quality assessment and identifying potential reporting gaps in the cost report system.
