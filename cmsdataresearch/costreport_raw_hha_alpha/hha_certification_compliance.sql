-- hha_certification_quality_metrics.sql

-- Business Purpose: Analyze Home Health Agency certification status and quality indicators
-- by examining certification-related entries across cost report worksheets. This helps
-- identify compliance patterns, certification maintenance, and quality metrics reporting
-- which are crucial for regulatory compliance and quality assurance.

WITH certification_entries AS (
    -- Extract certification-related entries from various worksheets
    SELECT 
        rpt_rec_num,
        wksht_cd,
        line_num,
        clmn_num,
        itm_alphnmrc_itm_txt,
        mimi_src_file_date
    FROM mimi_ws_1.cmsdataresearch.costreport_raw_hha_alpha
    WHERE 
        -- Focus on certification worksheets and quality metric sections
        wksht_cd IN ('S1', 'S2', 'S3')
        AND itm_alphnmrc_itm_txt IS NOT NULL
        -- Limit to recent 5 years of data
        AND YEAR(mimi_src_file_date) >= YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) - 5
),

certification_summary AS (
    -- Aggregate certification status and requirements
    SELECT 
        rpt_rec_num,
        mimi_src_file_date,
        COUNT(DISTINCT wksht_cd) as reported_sections,
        MAX(CASE WHEN wksht_cd = 'S1' THEN itm_alphnmrc_itm_txt END) as primary_certification,
        COUNT(DISTINCT itm_alphnmrc_itm_txt) as unique_responses
    FROM certification_entries
    GROUP BY 
        rpt_rec_num,
        mimi_src_file_date
)

-- Generate final analysis results
SELECT 
    YEAR(mimi_src_file_date) as report_year,
    COUNT(DISTINCT rpt_rec_num) as total_providers,
    AVG(reported_sections) as avg_reported_sections,
    COUNT(DISTINCT primary_certification) as distinct_certification_types,
    AVG(unique_responses) as avg_responses_per_provider
FROM certification_summary
GROUP BY 
    YEAR(mimi_src_file_date)
ORDER BY 
    report_year DESC;

-- How this query works:
-- 1. First CTE filters for certification-related worksheets and recent data
-- 2. Second CTE aggregates certification information by provider and date
-- 3. Final query summarizes certification metrics by year
--
-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes certification information is primarily in worksheets S1, S2, S3
-- - Limited to last 5 years of data for trending analysis
-- - Relies on consistent worksheet coding across reporting periods
-- - Does not account for potential changes in certification requirements over time
--
-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic analysis by incorporating provider location data
-- 2. Compare certification patterns across different provider sizes
-- 3. Analyze correlation between certification compliance and financial performance
-- 4. Include specific quality metric tracking from additional worksheets
-- 5. Create provider-specific certification timeline analysis

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on core certification compliance metrics and may need adjustment based on specific worksheet codes relevant to different certification requirements. The 5-year lookback period can be modified based on analysis needs. Worksheet codes (S1, S2, S3) should be verified against actual data structure.
