-- medicare_service_geographic_opportunities.sql

-- Business Purpose:
-- Identify underutilized Medicare services that could represent expansion opportunities 
-- for healthcare providers across different specialty areas. This analysis helps organizations
-- spot potential market gaps and service line development opportunities by comparing
-- service utilization rates across different procedure categories.

-- Main Query
WITH ranked_services AS (
  SELECT 
    description,
    hcpcs,
    SUM(allowed_services) as total_services,
    SUM(allowed_charges) as total_charges,
    SUM(payment) as total_payment,
    -- Calculate average reimbursement per service
    ROUND(SUM(payment) / SUM(allowed_services), 2) as avg_payment_per_service,
    -- Get the specialty category from the description
    SPLIT(description, ' - ')[0] as specialty_category
  FROM mimi_ws_1.cmsdataresearch.partb_national_summary_bess
  WHERE allowed_services > 0
  GROUP BY description, hcpcs
),

specialty_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    specialty_category,
    AVG(avg_payment_per_service) as avg_specialty_payment,
    AVG(total_services) as avg_specialty_volume
  FROM ranked_services
  GROUP BY specialty_category
)

SELECT 
  rs.specialty_category,
  rs.description,
  rs.hcpcs,
  rs.total_services,
  rs.avg_payment_per_service,
  sm.avg_specialty_payment,
  -- Calculate volume comparison to specialty average
  ROUND((rs.total_services - sm.avg_specialty_volume) / sm.avg_specialty_volume * 100, 2) 
    as pct_diff_from_avg_volume,
  -- Calculate payment comparison to specialty average  
  ROUND((rs.avg_payment_per_service - sm.avg_specialty_payment) / sm.avg_specialty_payment * 100, 2) 
    as pct_diff_from_avg_payment
FROM ranked_services rs
JOIN specialty_metrics sm ON rs.specialty_category = sm.specialty_category
WHERE rs.total_services < sm.avg_specialty_volume  -- Focus on underutilized services
  AND rs.avg_payment_per_service > sm.avg_specialty_payment -- With above average payments
ORDER BY 
  rs.specialty_category,
  pct_diff_from_avg_payment DESC;

-- How the Query Works:
-- 1. First CTE (ranked_services) aggregates service volumes and payments by procedure
-- 2. Second CTE (specialty_metrics) calculates average metrics for each specialty
-- 3. Main query joins these together to identify procedures that are:
--    - Below average in utilization volume
--    - Above average in payment rates
--    This combination suggests potential market opportunities

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes the first part of the description reliably indicates specialty category
-- 2. Does not account for regional variations in practice patterns
-- 3. Does not consider complexity of procedures or required resources
-- 4. Historical data may not reflect current market conditions
-- 5. Some specialties may have natural variation in procedure volumes

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add filters for specific specialties of interest
-- 2. Include year-over-year trend analysis
-- 3. Add minimum volume thresholds
-- 4. Calculate market size estimates based on population data
-- 5. Include analysis of competitive intensity in each specialty

    - Additional Notes: The query identifies service opportunities by comparing procedure-level metrics against specialty averages. The specialty categorization relies on consistent description formatting in the source data. Consider validating specialty categories before using results for strategic planning. Query performance may be impacted with large datasets due to multiple aggregations.
