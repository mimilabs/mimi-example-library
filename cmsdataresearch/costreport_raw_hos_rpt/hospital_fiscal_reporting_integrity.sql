-- Hospital Fiscal Year Report Validity and Coverage Analytics
-- 
-- Business Purpose:
-- This analysis helps healthcare financial analysts and compliance teams:
-- - Identify potential gaps in hospital cost reporting coverage
-- - Validate fiscal year reporting integrity across providers
-- - Support data quality initiatives for CMS reimbursement accuracy
--

WITH fiscal_year_metrics AS (
  -- Calculate key fiscal period metrics per provider
  SELECT 
    prvdr_num,
    COUNT(DISTINCT YEAR(fy_bgn_dt)) as reported_years,
    MIN(fy_bgn_dt) as earliest_report,
    MAX(fy_end_dt) as latest_report,
    -- Check for any overlapping or missing periods
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(DISTINCT fy_bgn_dt) as duplicate_period_count,
    -- Calculate average fiscal year duration in days
    AVG(DATEDIFF(fy_end_dt, fy_bgn_dt)) as avg_period_length
  FROM mimi_ws_1.cmsdataresearch.costreport_raw_hos_rpt
  GROUP BY prvdr_num
),

provider_status AS (
  -- Classify providers based on reporting patterns
  SELECT
    m.*,
    CASE 
      WHEN avg_period_length < 350 THEN 'Short Period'
      WHEN avg_period_length > 380 THEN 'Long Period'
      ELSE 'Normal'
    END as period_classification,
    CASE
      WHEN duplicate_period_count > 0 THEN 'Has Duplicates'
      ELSE 'Clean'
    END as duplicate_status
  FROM fiscal_year_metrics m
)

-- Final summary with key reporting integrity metrics
SELECT
  period_classification,
  duplicate_status,
  COUNT(DISTINCT prvdr_num) as provider_count,
  ROUND(AVG(reported_years), 1) as avg_years_reported,
  ROUND(AVG(avg_period_length), 1) as avg_fiscal_period_days,
  MIN(earliest_report) as earliest_report_date,
  MAX(latest_report) as latest_report_date
FROM provider_status
GROUP BY period_classification, duplicate_status
ORDER BY period_classification, duplicate_status;

-- How this works:
-- 1. First CTE calculates key metrics per provider including period counts and durations
-- 2. Second CTE classifies providers based on reporting patterns
-- 3. Final query summarizes the results to identify potential data quality issues
--
-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes fiscal year periods should be approximately 365 days
-- - Does not account for legitimate reasons for shorter/longer periods
-- - Limited to basic temporal validation without deep financial validation
--
-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic analysis to identify regional patterns in reporting issues
-- 2. Incorporate provider type analysis to see if certain facilities have more issues
-- 3. Create trending analysis to see if data quality is improving over time
-- 4. Add financial impact analysis for providers with reporting anomalies

    - Additional Notes: This query emphasizes data quality validation for fiscal reporting periods, specifically focusing on identifying abnormal reporting patterns that could impact CMS reimbursement accuracy. The metrics around fiscal period length and duplicate reporting are particularly valuable for compliance teams working on cost report submissions.
