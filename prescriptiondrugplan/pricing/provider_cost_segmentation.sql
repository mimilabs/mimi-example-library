-- Medicare Drug Plan Cost Analysis by Provider Scale
-- 
-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze Medicare drug plan costs across providers to identify key providers by volume
-- and average cost levels. This helps understand market concentration and cost patterns
-- in the Part D program, informing strategic decisions around network partnerships,
-- competitive positioning, and cost management opportunities.
--

WITH provider_summary AS (
  -- Aggregate metrics by contract to understand provider scale
  SELECT 
    contract_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ndc) as total_drugs,
    COUNT(DISTINCT plan_id) as total_plans,
    AVG(unit_cost) as avg_unit_cost,
    -- Get latest data point
    MAX(mimi_src_file_date) as latest_data_date
  FROM mimi_ws_1.prescriptiondrugplan.pricing
  WHERE days_supply = 30  -- Focus on standard monthly supply
  GROUP BY contract_id
),

  -- Segment providers by size and cost levels
  SELECT
    *,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_drugs DESC) as drug_quartile,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY avg_unit_cost DESC) as cost_quartile
  FROM provider_summary
)

-- Final output showing provider landscape
SELECT
  CASE 
    WHEN drug_quartile = 1 THEN 'Large'
    WHEN drug_quartile = 2 THEN 'Medium'
    WHEN drug_quartile = 3 THEN 'Small'
    ELSE 'Micro'
  END AS provider_size,
  
  CASE
    WHEN cost_quartile = 1 THEN 'Premium'
    WHEN cost_quartile = 2 THEN 'High'
    WHEN cost_quartile = 3 THEN 'Moderate'

GROUP BY drug_quartile, cost_quartile
ORDER BY provider_size, cost_segment;

--
-- How this works:
-- 1. First CTE aggregates key metrics by contract_id to understand provider scale
-- 2. Second CTE segments providers into quartiles by both size and cost
-- 3. Final query creates meaningful business segments and summarizes key metrics
--
-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Uses 30-day supply only for consistent comparison
-- - Assumes contract_id consistently identifies unique providers
-- - Point-in-time analysis based on latest data
-- - Does not account for geographic differences
--
-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic analysis by joining with plan_information
-- 2. Track segment changes over time using mimi_src_file_date
-- 3. Add drug type analysis using NDC classifications
-- 4. Include market share calculations using plan enrollment data
-- 5. Compare cost variations within each segment

    - Additional Notes: Query segments Medicare drug plan providers into size/cost quadrants for strategic analysis. Key metrics include number of drugs offered, plan count, and average unit costs. Best used for high-level market structure analysis and provider comparisons. Requires recent data in the pricing table and consistent contract_id values.
