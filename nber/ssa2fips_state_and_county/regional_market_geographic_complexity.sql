-- Title: Regional Healthcare Market Composition Analysis

/*
Business Purpose:
This query provides strategic insights into regional healthcare market composition by:
- Identifying unique metropolitan and county-level geographic configurations
- Enabling cross-reference between SSA and FIPS coding systems for multi-source data integration
- Supporting healthcare market segmentation and regional planning strategies

/*
Query Mechanics:
- First CTE (regional_market_summary) aggregates state-level geographic metadata
- Second CTE (cbsa_complexity_ranking) ranks states by CBSA complexity
- Final SELECT provides ranked output of state geographic configurations

Key Assumptions:
- Uses FY2023 CBSA codes as primary geographic reference
- Assumes non-null CBSA indicates meaningful geographic classification
- Limited to top 25 states by CBSA diversity

Potential Extensions:
1. Integrate population data for market size analysis
2. Compare geographic complexity across healthcare market segments
3. Develop predictive models for regional healthcare resource allocation

    - Additional Notes: Provides a ranking of states by their CBSA (Core Based Statistical Area) complexity, useful for understanding geographic market diversity. Limits analysis to top 25 states to prevent overwhelming output. Requires careful interpretation of results in context of broader regional healthcare market strategies.
