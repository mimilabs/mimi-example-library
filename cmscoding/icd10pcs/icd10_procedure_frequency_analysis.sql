-- ICD-10-PCS Procedure Code Analysis for Healthcare Strategic Insights

/*
Business Purpose:
Analyze ICD-10-PCS procedure codes to identify:
- Most frequent medical procedures
- Potential areas of clinical focus or specialization
- Trends in procedural complexity and types

Strategic Value:
- Support healthcare resource planning
- Inform medical service line strategy
- Benchmark procedural performance

/*
Query Mechanics:
- Two Common Table Expressions (CTEs) analyze procedure codes
- First CTE calculates procedure frequency and percentage
- Second CTE assesses procedural complexity
- Final SELECT combines insights, sorted by procedure frequency

Key Assumptions:
- Uses most recent data load
- Complexity based on code length as a proxy for procedural intricacy
- Top 25 procedures represent significant insights

Potential Extensions:
1. Time-series analysis of procedure trends
2. Geographical procedure distribution
3. Linking to cost or reimbursement data
4. Integration with clinical outcome metrics

Recommended Next Steps:
- Validate findings with clinical stakeholders
- Develop detailed visualization of results
- Incorporate additional contextual data sources

    - Additional Notes: Requires most recent data load for accurate insights. Complexity assessment uses code length as a proxy, which may not perfectly represent actual procedural complexity. Recommended for strategic healthcare planning and resource allocation.
