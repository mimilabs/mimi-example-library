-- Query Mechanics:
-- 1. Aggregates provider data by state and provider type
-- 2. Calculates provider count, city coverage, and contact information completeness
-- 3. Ranks states to identify high-potential market segments
-- 4. Generates a market potential index for strategic decision-making

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Data reflects a specific snapshot in time
-- - Assumes provider count correlates with market opportunity
-- - Limited by data completeness and reporting accuracy

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Incorporate population density data
-- 2. Add revenue or insurance network information
-- 3. Analyze provider concentration by ZIP code
-- 4. Include time-series analysis of provider distribution changes
