-- Query Mechanics:
-- 1. Uses Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate marketing complexity metrics
-- 2. Aggregates data by plan ID type
-- 3. Computes a marketing engagement score based on URL presence, contact info, and marketing name diversity

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Marketing engagement score is a simplified proxy for plan marketing sophistication
-- - Does not account for URL or contact information quality
-- - Assumes more diverse marketing approaches indicate more complex marketing strategy

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Incorporate URL complexity analysis
-- 2. Add temporal trend analysis of marketing strategies
-- 3. Link with plan performance or enrollment data
-- 4. Analyze marketing language complexity using natural language processing techniques

    - Additional Notes: Query provides a multi-dimensional analysis of marketing strategies across healthcare.gov plan types, using engagement scoring mechanism. Suitable for understanding plan diversity and digital marketing approaches, but requires contextual interpretation due to simplified scoring method.
