-- Title: MUA/P Provider Access and Service Intensity Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- This query provides insights into the relationship between provider availability and 
-- service intensity across Medically Underserved Areas/Populations (MUA/P). It helps
-- healthcare organizations and policymakers identify areas where provider shortages
-- are most severe and understand the corresponding service delivery challenges.
-- The analysis supports strategic planning for provider recruitment and resource allocation.

WITH active_designations AS (
    -- Filter for active MUA/P designations only
    SELECT *
    FROM mimi_ws_1.hrsa.mua_det
    WHERE muap_status_description = 'Designated'
    AND medically_underserved_area_population_muap_withdrawal_date IS NULL
),

provider_tiers AS (
    -- Categorize areas by provider availability
    SELECT 
        state_name,
        muap_service_area_name,
        providers_per_1000_population,
        imu_score,
        designation_population_in_a_medically_underserved_area_population_muap as population,
        CASE 
            WHEN providers_per_1000_population < 0.5 THEN 'Severe Shortage'
            WHEN providers_per_1000_population < 1.0 THEN 'Moderate Shortage'
            ELSE 'Better Access'
        END as provider_access_tier
    FROM active_designations
    WHERE providers_per_1000_population IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT 
    provider_access_tier,
    COUNT(*) as area_count,
    ROUND(AVG(imu_score), 2) as avg_imu_score,
    ROUND(AVG(providers_per_1000_population), 3) as avg_providers_ratio,
    ROUND(SUM(population)/1000000, 2) as total_population_millions,
    ROUND(AVG(population), 0) as avg_area_population
FROM provider_tiers
GROUP BY provider_access_tier
ORDER BY avg_providers_ratio ASC;

-- How it works:
-- 1. First CTE filters for currently active MUA/P designations
-- 2. Second CTE creates meaningful tiers based on provider availability
-- 3. Main query aggregates key metrics by provider access tier
-- 4. Results show distribution of areas, IMU scores, and population across tiers

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes current designations are most relevant for analysis
-- - Limited to areas with reported provider ratios
-- - Uses simplified tier categorization that may need adjustment
-- - Does not account for provider type or specialization

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic grouping (by state/region) to identify regional patterns
-- 2. Include trend analysis by comparing against historical provider ratios
-- 3. Incorporate population demographics to understand service needs
-- 4. Add financial metrics to assess resource allocation requirements
-- 5. Create more granular provider ratio tiers for detailed analysis

    - Additional Notes: The query emphasizes provider availability as a key metric for assessing medical underservice severity. The three-tier categorization (Severe Shortage, Moderate Shortage, Better Access) provides a clear framework for prioritizing interventions. Consider adjusting the provider ratio thresholds (0.5 and 1.0) based on specific program requirements or regional standards.
