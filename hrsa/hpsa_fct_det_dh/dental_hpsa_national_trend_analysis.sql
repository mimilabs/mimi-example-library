-- Title: National Dental HPSA Designation Evolution and Strategic Insights

-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze the longitudinal trends of dental Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) designations
-- to provide strategic insights for healthcare resource allocation, policy planning, and 
-- identifying emerging dental care access challenges across different states and regions.

WITH designation_evolution AS (
    -- Aggregate and analyze HPSA designation characteristics over time
    SELECT 
        primary_state_name,
        YEAR(hpsa_designation_date) AS designation_year,
        COUNT(DISTINCT hpsa_id) AS total_hpsa_designations,
        SUM(hpsa_designation_population) AS total_affected_population,
        AVG(hpsa_score) AS avg_shortage_severity,
        SUM(hpsa_fte) AS total_providers_needed
    FROM mimi_ws_1.hrsa.hpsa_fct_det_dh
    WHERE hpsa_status = 'Designated'
    GROUP BY 
        primary_state_name, 
        YEAR(hpsa_designation_date)
)

SELECT 
    designation_year,
    COUNT(DISTINCT primary_state_name) AS states_with_hpsas,
    SUM(total_hpsa_designations) AS national_hpsa_count,
    SUM(total_affected_population) AS national_affected_population,
    ROUND(AVG(avg_shortage_severity), 2) AS national_avg_shortage_score,
    SUM(total_providers_needed) AS national_provider_shortage
FROM designation_evolution
GROUP BY designation_year
ORDER BY designation_year;

-- Query Execution Overview:
-- 1. Creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) to aggregate HPSA data by state and year
-- 2. Filters for active 'Designated' HPSA areas
-- 3. Calculates key metrics including number of designations, population impact, 
--    average shortage severity, and provider needs
-- 4. Generates a national summary of dental HPSA trends over time

-- Key Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Only considers currently 'Designated' HPSA areas
-- - Uses designation date as the primary temporal reference
-- - Aggregates data at the state level with annual granularity
-- - Does not account for withdrawn or proposed HPSA areas

-- Potential Query Extensions:
-- 1. Add metropolitan_indicator to compare urban vs rural trends
-- 2. Incorporate poverty percentage analysis
-- 3. Create state-level comparative rankings
-- 4. Develop predictive models for future dental care shortages

    - Additional Notes: This query provides a high-level overview of national dental Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) trends, focusing on year-over-year changes in designation count, population impact, and provider shortages. Users should be aware that it only considers currently designated HPSAs and may not capture historical changes in full detail.
