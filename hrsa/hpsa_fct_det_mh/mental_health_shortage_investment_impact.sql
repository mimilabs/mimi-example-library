/*
QUERY MECHANICS:
- Calculates a financial impact score combining HPSA score, required providers, and poverty rate
- Estimates potential investment required to address mental health provider shortages
- Provides state-level aggregation of mental health shortage metrics

ASSUMPTIONS:
- Average mental health provider annual cost estimated at $150,000
- Only considers 'Designated' HPSA status
- Focuses on areas with HPSA score > 15 (significant shortage)

POTENTIAL EXTENSIONS:
1. Add metropolitan vs rural comparison
2. Include Medicaid eligibility metrics
3. Time-series analysis of changing shortage landscapes
4. Integrate with federal funding allocation models
