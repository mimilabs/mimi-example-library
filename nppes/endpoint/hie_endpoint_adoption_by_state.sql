/* HIE Endpoint Analysis - Provider Communication Capabilities
 
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes the distribution and characteristics of Health Information Exchange (HIE) 
endpoints across healthcare providers and organizations. This information is crucial for:
- Understanding provider communication capabilities
- Assessing healthcare interoperability readiness
- Identifying gaps in electronic health information exchange
- Supporting care coordination initiatives

/* How this query works:
1. Creates a summary of endpoints using the latest available data
2. Counts unique providers and organizations for each endpoint type and state
3. Calculates penetration rates within each state
4. Orders results by state and provider count for easy analysis

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Uses the most recent data snapshot only
- Assumes one primary endpoint type per provider/organization
- State-level analysis may not capture cross-border healthcare delivery
- Does not account for endpoint activity or usage patterns

Possible Extensions:
1. Add temporal analysis to track adoption trends over time:
   - Add year-over-year comparison
   - Track growth rates by endpoint type

2. Enhanced geographic analysis:
   - Include regional groupings
   - Add urban/rural designations
   - Map to healthcare markets (HSAs/HRRs)

3. Provider-level analysis:
   - Break down by provider specialty
   - Analyze by organization size
   - Include quality metrics correlation

4. Network analysis:
   - Identify communication clusters
   - Analyze cross-organization connections
   - Map referral patterns

    - Additional Notes: Query provides state-level breakdown of HIE endpoint adoption patterns and can be used for identifying regional gaps in healthcare information exchange capabilities. Results are filtered to latest data snapshot only and require the state field to be populated. Performance may be impacted with very large datasets due to window functions.
