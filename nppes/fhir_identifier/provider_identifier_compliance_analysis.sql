-- Healthcare Provider Identifier Compliance and Network Validation Analysis

/*
Business Purpose:
Analyze healthcare provider identifier consistency across different systems and identify potential
data quality or compliance risks by examining identifier variations and validation metrics.

Target Audience: 
- Healthcare Compliance Officers
- Network Management Teams
- Payer/Provider Contract Management

/*
Query Mechanics:
- Two-stage CTE approach for comprehensive analysis
- Focuses on active, official identifiers
- Categorizes providers by identifier complexity and compliance

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes 'official' identifiers are most relevant
- Uses current date for active identifier validation
- May not capture historically complex identifier scenarios

Potential Extensions:
1. Add geographic (state) dimension to analysis
2. Integrate with provider performance metrics
3. Create alert mechanism for low-compliance providers

    - Additional Notes: Query requires current active NPPES data snapshot and focuses on official identifiers. Complexity scoring may need periodic recalibration based on evolving healthcare identifier standards.
