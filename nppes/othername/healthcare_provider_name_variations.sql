-- Query Methodology:
-- 1. Categorizes different types of organization names
-- 2. Counts unique organizations and total name variations
-- 3. Calculates percentage distribution of name types
-- 4. Identifies top Doing Business As names and their market presence

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Data is self-reported and may contain inconsistencies
-- - Focuses only on Type 2 NPIs (organizations)
-- - Snapshot of data at a specific point in time

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Analyze name changes over time
-- 2. Correlate name variations with organization type or location
-- 3. Investigate patterns of name rebranding
-- 4. Link with other provider datasets for deeper insights
