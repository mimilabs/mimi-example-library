/*
Query Mechanics:
1. Create CTE to calculate reference metrics per topic
2. Rank topics by unique reference count
3. Return top 50 most interconnected topics

Assumptions:
- More references indicate higher topic complexity
- Latest reference date suggests recent content updates

Potential Extensions:
- Analyze references by medical specialty
- Create topic relationship network visualization
- Develop content recommendation algorithm

Limitations:
- Snapshot represents a specific moment in time
- Doesn't capture qualitative relationship strength
- Dependent on MedlinePlus content curation
