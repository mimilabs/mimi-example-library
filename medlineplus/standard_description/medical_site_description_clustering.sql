-- Site Description Semantic Clustering and Trend Analysis
-- Business Purpose:
-- - Identify semantic clusters of medical sites based on description text
-- - Analyze description complexity and potential categorization opportunities
-- - Support content strategy and site classification for medical knowledge platforms

-- Query Execution Overview:
-- 1. Creates metrics for site descriptions
-- 2. Performs basic semantic categorization
-- 3. Tracks description complexity and distribution
-- 4. Provides trend analysis of site descriptions

-- Assumptions:
-- - Descriptions are representative of site characteristics
-- - Text-based categorization is a preliminary approach
-- - Temporal data represents meaningful updates

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Advanced NLP for more nuanced categorization
-- 2. Integration with additional metadata tables
-- 3. Machine learning-based site classification
-- 4. Trend analysis of description complexity over time
