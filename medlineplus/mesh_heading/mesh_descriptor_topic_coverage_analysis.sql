-- File: mesh_descriptor_topic_coverage_analysis.sql
-- Purpose: Analyze the breadth and depth of MeSH descriptor coverage across MedlinePlus topics to identify potential information gaps and improve content strategy

-- Business Context:
-- This query helps content strategists and medical information managers understand how comprehensively MedlinePlus topics are categorized
-- by exploring the distribution and uniqueness of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors

WITH descriptor_coverage AS (
    SELECT 
        descriptor,  -- Specific MeSH descriptor

        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY unique_topic_count DESC, total_topic_associations DESC) AS descriptor_importance_rank

    latest_usage_date,
    descriptor_importance_rank
FROM 
    descriptor_insight_ranking
WHERE 
    topic_coverage_percentage > 1.0  -- Focus on descriptors covering more than 1% of topics
ORDER BY

LIMIT 50;

-- Query Mechanics:
-- 1. First CTE (descriptor_coverage) calculates detailed metrics for each MeSH descriptor
-- 2. Second CTE (descriptor_insight_ranking) ranks descriptors by their importance
-- 3. Final SELECT provides comprehensive insights with ranking

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes consistent topic_id and descriptor mapping
-- - Percentage calculations based on available data snapshot
-- - May not capture full historical variations in MeSH descriptor usage

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Add temporal trend analysis of descriptor usage
-- 2. Compare descriptor coverage across different medical domains
-- 3. Integrate with additional metadata to enrich insights

-- Example Business Applications:
-- - Identify underrepresented medical topics
-- - Guide content development strategies
-- - Improve medical information search and categorization
