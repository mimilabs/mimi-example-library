Query Mechanics:
- Creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) to aggregate plan characteristics
- Calculates market share based on unique plan configurations
- Ranks plan configurations to highlight market positioning
- Limits output to top 25 configurations for readability

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Data represents a snapshot of Medicare Advantage market
- Market share calculated within this dataset, not entire US market
- Does not account for temporal changes in plan configurations

Potential Extensions:
1. Add time-series analysis to track configuration evolution
2. Join with enrollment data to weight market share by membership
3. Incorporate geographic breakdown by adding state/county dimensions
4. Create visualization of plan configuration complexity
