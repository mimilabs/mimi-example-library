-- How the Query Works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to aggregate dental coverage metrics by organization and plan type
-- 2. Calculates the percentage of plans offering different types of dental coverage
-- 3. Identifies market opportunities based on coverage patterns
-- 4. Filters out segments with too few plans for meaningful analysis

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes current coverage patterns indicate market opportunities
-- 2. Does not account for regional variations in dental coverage needs
-- 3. Does not consider cost structures or profitability of dental benefits
-- 4. Market opportunity thresholds are illustrative and may need adjustment

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic analysis to identify regional market gaps
-- 2. Include cost-sharing analysis to identify pricing opportunities
-- 3. Trend analysis by comparing multiple years of data
-- 4. Competitive analysis focusing on specific organization types
-- 5. Integration with enrollment data to weight market opportunities

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on identifying market gaps and business opportunities in Medicare Advantage dental coverage offerings. It provides percentages and categorical assessments of market opportunities based on coverage patterns across different organization types and plan types. The 5-plan minimum threshold and market opportunity thresholds (30%, 40%, 50%) can be adjusted based on specific business needs.
