-- Medicare Advantage Benefits Metadata - File Structure and Content Mapping
--
-- Business Purpose: 
-- This query examines the organization and content mapping of Medicare Advantage benefits data files to:
-- 1. Map which files contain what types of information
-- 2. Help analysts quickly locate specific benefit information
-- 3. Understand the relative complexity of different data files
-- 4. Support data quality and completeness assessment

SELECT 
    -- Group benefits information by source file
    file,
    
    -- Count distinct fields and categories per file
    COUNT(DISTINCT name) as field_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT service_category) as category_count,
    
    -- Identify key service categories in each file using collect_set
    ARRAY_JOIN(COLLECT_SET(service_category), '; ') as covered_categories,
    
    -- Get the date range of the data
    MIN(mimi_src_file_date) as earliest_file_date,
    MAX(mimi_src_file_date) as latest_file_date,
    
    -- Calculate field type distribution
    COUNT(CASE WHEN type LIKE '%varchar%' THEN 1 END) as text_fields,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN type LIKE '%int%' THEN 1 END) as numeric_fields,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN type LIKE '%date%' THEN 1 END) as date_fields

FROM mimi_ws_1.partcd.pbp_metadata
WHERE service_category IS NOT NULL

GROUP BY file
ORDER BY field_count DESC;

-- How the Query Works:
-- 1. Groups metadata by source file name
-- 2. Calculates counts of fields and distinct service categories
-- 3. Creates a concatenated list of service categories using collect_set and array_join
-- 4. Determines the date range of available data
-- 5. Breaks down field types into basic categories
-- 6. Orders results by complexity (number of fields)
-- 7. Filters out null service categories for cleaner results

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes file names are consistent and meaningful
-- 2. Service categories with NULL values are excluded
-- 3. Type classification is based on simple pattern matching
-- 4. Date range is based on source file dates, not actual data coverage

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add validation rules checking for required fields per file
-- 2. Include analysis of code_and_values distribution
-- 3. Compare file structures across different time periods
-- 4. Add complexity scoring based on field types and relationships
-- 5. Create file dependency mapping based on shared fields

    - Additional Notes: The query provides a high-level inventory of Medicare Advantage data files, showing their content scope and structure. The COLLECT_SET function may impact performance on very large datasets. Query assumes consistent file naming and data type patterns across the metadata. Consider adding materialization if used frequently in reporting.
