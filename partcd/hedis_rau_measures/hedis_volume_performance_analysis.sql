-- HEDIS Risk Measure Volume-Outcome Analysis
-- Purpose: Analyze the relationship between member volume and quality outcomes
-- across HEDIS measures to identify potential economies of scale and 
-- best practices from high-volume, high-performing contracts.
-- 
-- Business Value:
-- - Identifies optimal member volume thresholds for quality performance
-- - Supports network planning and contract optimization decisions
-- - Helps target quality improvement initiatives based on plan size
-- - Informs value-based care program design

-- How it works:
-- 1. Creates volume segments by splitting contracts into quartiles based on member_count
-- 2. Calculates key performance metrics for each volume segment
-- 3. Joins with measure names and formats final output
-- 4. Orders results by measure and volume quartile for easy comparison

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Uses most recent year's data only
-- - Assumes member_count is a valid indicator of contract size
-- - Does not account for regional variations
-- - May be sensitive to outliers in small volume segments
-- - Observed/Expected ratio may not be meaningful for all measure types

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trend analysis by volume segment
-- 2. Include geographic region as additional dimension
-- 3. Add statistical significance testing between segments
-- 4. Create volume-based peer groups for benchmarking
-- 5. Analyze correlation between volume and performance variation

    - Additional Notes: Query segments contracts by member volume to analyze economies of scale. Performance ratio >1.0 indicates better than expected outcomes. Exercise caution when interpreting results for measures with small denominators or high variability. Consider minimum volume thresholds for reliable analysis.
