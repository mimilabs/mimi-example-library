-- Purpose: Analyze core performance metrics and member volumes for HEDIS measures
-- to identify opportunities for quality improvement and resource allocation
--
-- Business Value:
-- - Identifies high-impact measures based on member volume and performance
-- - Tracks year-over-year performance changes
-- - Supports data-driven quality improvement prioritization
-- - Enables identification of measures needing focused attention

WITH measure_stats AS (
  SELECT

    -- Calculate average performance and member volumes
    AVG(CAST(rate AS DOUBLE)) as avg_rate,
    COUNT(DISTINCT contract_number) as contract_count,

    -- Calculate measure reach
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(numerator) / NULLIF(SUM(denominator), 0), 2) as overall_rate
  FROM mimi_ws_1.partcd.hedis_measures
  WHERE hedis_year >= 2020  -- Focus on recent years

SELECT
  measure_code,
  measure_name,
  hedis_year,
  ROUND(avg_rate, 2) as avg_performance_rate,
  contract_count as participating_contracts,
  total_numerator as members_meeting_measure,
  total_denominator as eligible_members,
  overall_rate as population_success_rate,
  -- Calculate opportunity size

-- How this works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to aggregate key statistics by measure and year
-- 2. Calculates average performance rates and member volumes
-- 3. Computes overall success rates across all contracts
-- 4. Identifies improvement opportunities based on eligible population
-- 5. Filters to focus on measures with meaningful sample sizes

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Requires non-null rate values
-- - Focuses on measures with at least 1000 eligible members
-- - Does not account for measure-specific benchmarks
-- - Treats all eligible members equally (no risk adjustment)

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trending analysis
-- 2. Include statistical significance testing
-- 3. Add measure category/domain analysis
-- 4. Compare against national benchmarks
-- 5. Add cost/impact weighting factors

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on population-level impact by analyzing the volume of members affected by each HEDIS measure and quantifying improvement opportunities. Best used for strategic planning and resource allocation decisions. Note that the 1000 member threshold may need adjustment based on specific program size.
