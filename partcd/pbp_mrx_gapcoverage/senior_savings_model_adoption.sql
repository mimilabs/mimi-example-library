-- Part D Senior Savings Model Impact Analysis
-- Business Purpose: Analyze the adoption and characteristics of plans participating in the Part D 
-- Senior Savings Model, which caps insulin costs for beneficiaries. This analysis helps understand 
-- market penetration of this important cost-saving initiative and its correlation with plan attributes.

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to summarize unique plans and their key attributes
-- 2. Calculates participation rates and characteristics by plan type and organization
-- 3. Provides percentage distribution of plans participating in the Senior Savings Model
-- 4. Includes average number of formulary tiers to understand plan complexity

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes part_d_enhncd_cvrg_demo field accurately reflects Senior Savings Model participation
-- - Limited to snapshot of most recent data based on mimi_src_file_date
-- - Does not account for changes in participation status over time
-- - Does not consider plan enrollment numbers or market share

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographical analysis by incorporating state/region information
-- 2. Include trend analysis by comparing multiple time periods
-- 3. Add cost-sharing analysis by incorporating tier-specific cost sharing data
-- 4. Correlate with plan star ratings or other quality metrics
-- 5. Analyze impact on insulin-specific tiers and coverage

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on Part D Senior Savings Model participation analysis across different plan types and organization types. The results show participation rates, plan distribution, and formulary complexity metrics. Note that the analysis is point-in-time based on the most recent data snapshot and doesn't reflect historical trends or beneficiary enrollment numbers.
