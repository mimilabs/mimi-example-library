-- Home Health Agency Claims - Regional Service Delivery Patterns
-- ===============================================================

/*
Business Purpose:
    Analyze regional distribution and temporal patterns of home health services to:
    1. Identify geographic concentrations of HHA services
    2. Understand seasonal variations in service delivery
    3. Support network adequacy and service accessibility planning
    
The insights help healthcare organizations:
    - Optimize service coverage across regions
    - Plan staffing based on seasonal demands
    - Target areas for potential expansion

/*
How this query works:
1. Creates monthly aggregations by state in regional_summary CTE
2. Calculates state-level metrics in state_rankings CTE
3. Combines both views for final analysis with temporal and comparative metrics

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Assumes state codes are valid and present
- Does not account for provider service areas crossing state lines
- Limited to claims with positive charges only
- Time periods are based on claim start dates

Possible Extensions:
1. Add geographic clustering analysis to identify service hotspots
2. Include demographic factors for population-adjusted analysis
3. Add year-over-year growth metrics by region
4. Incorporate quality metrics for service delivery assessment
5. Add weather/seasonal factors impact analysis

    - Additional Notes: This query focuses on geographic distribution patterns and requires accurate provider state codes in the data. The temporal analysis is based on claim start dates, which may not fully reflect service delivery timing. For accurate payment analysis, ensure the clm_pmt_amt values are properly validated before using the results for financial planning.
