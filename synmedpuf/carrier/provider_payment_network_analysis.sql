/* 
Query Mechanics:
- Aggregates carrier claims by state and provider specialty
- Calculates key financial metrics
- Filters for valid payment records
- Orders results by total claim payments

Assumptions:
- Uses synthesized Medicare claims data
- Focuses on non-zero payment claims
- Provider specialty codes represent meaningful service categories

Data Limitations:
- Synthetic data does not represent actual Medicare claims
- Limited to available provider classification systems
- Does not include individual provider identifiers

Potential Extensions:
1. Add time-based analysis (by claim date)
2. Incorporate beneficiary demographic segmentation
3. Compare payment ratios across different provider types
4. Integrate with other Medicare claims tables
