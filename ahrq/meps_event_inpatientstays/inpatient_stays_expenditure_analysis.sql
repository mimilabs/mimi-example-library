-- Healthcare Utilization and Expenditure Analysis for Inpatient Stays

-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze hospital inpatient stay patterns, focusing on key metrics like 
-- average length of stay, total expenditures, and primary reasons for hospitalization
-- to support healthcare resource planning and cost management strategies

-- Query Methodology:
-- 1. Aggregates inpatient stay data by reason for hospitalization
-- 2. Calculates key metrics: total stays, average nights, total/average expenditures
-- 3. Breaks down expenditures by primary insurance payer
-- 4. Provides a comprehensive view of healthcare utilization

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Uses imputed and edited data columns (e.g., numnighx, ipxp_yy_x)
-- - Relies on self-reported hospitalization reasons
-- - Data represents a sample, not entire population
-- - May not capture all nuances of healthcare utilization

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Add demographic segmentation (age, gender)
-- 2. Trend analysis across multiple years
-- 3. Detailed procedure and condition code analysis
