-- dental_visit_complexity_index.sql
-- Purpose: Create a dental visit complexity index to understand:
-- 1. The mix of preventive vs complex treatments per visit
-- 2. How this correlates with total charges and provider types
-- 3. Support population health management and resource planning

WITH visit_complexity AS (
  -- Calculate a complexity score for each visit based on procedures
  SELECT 
    dupersid,
    dvdateyr,
    -- Basic preventive care (weight: 1)
    (COALESCE(examine, 0) +

     COALESCE(fluoride, 0)) * 1 +
    -- Moderate procedures (weight: 2)
    (COALESCE(filling, 0) + 
     COALESCE(sealant, 0) + 
     COALESCE(extract, 0)) * 2 +
    -- Complex procedures (weight: 3)
    (COALESCE(rootcanl, 0) + 
     COALESCE(crowns, 0) + 
     COALESCE(implant, 0) +

    CASE

      ELSE 'Other'
    END as provider_type
  FROM mimi_ws_1.ahrq.meps_event_dentalvisits

  END as care_complexity,
  COUNT(*) as visit_count,
  ROUND(AVG(complexity_score), 2) as avg_complexity_score,
  ROUND(AVG(total_charge), 2) as avg_total_charge,
  ROUND(AVG(total_charge)/NULLIF(AVG(complexity_score), 0), 2) as charge_per_complexity_point

-- How it works:
-- 1. Creates a complexity score by weighting different dental procedures
-- 2. Groups visits into complexity tiers
-- 3. Analyzes patterns by year and provider type
-- 4. Calculates cost efficiency metrics

-- Assumptions and limitations:
-- 1. Assumes procedure weights reflect relative complexity
-- 2. Limited to procedures explicitly tracked in the dataset
-- 3. Does not account for patient-specific factors
-- 4. Charges may not reflect actual costs or reimbursements

-- Possible extensions:
-- 1. Add patient demographics to identify population segments
-- 2. Include geographic analysis of complexity patterns
-- 3. Create predictive models for resource planning
-- 4. Compare complexity trends across insurance types
-- 5. Analyze seasonal patterns in complex procedures

    - Additional Notes: The query creates a weighted complexity scoring system for dental visits that can help practices and insurers understand treatment intensity patterns. Note that the complexity weights (1,2,3) are simplified assumptions and may need adjustment based on actual clinical standards. The charge_per_complexity_point metric provides a novel efficiency measure but should be interpreted alongside other clinical quality indicators.
