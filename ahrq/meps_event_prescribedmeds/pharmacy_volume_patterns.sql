-- high_volume_pharmacies_and_drug_patterns.sql

-- Business Purpose:
-- Identify high-volume pharmacy providers and their prescription patterns
-- to support pharmacy network optimization and inventory management.
-- This analysis helps healthcare organizations and PBMs understand 
-- dispensing patterns and potential areas for network improvements.

-- How this query works:
-- 1. First CTE aggregates prescription metrics by pharmacy type and drug
-- 2. Second CTE identifies high-volume pharmacy types
-- 3. Final query joins these together to show top drugs within each pharmacy type
-- 4. Results are filtered to focus on meaningful volumes only

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes phartp1 (primary pharmacy type) is representative
-- 2. Minimum thresholds (1000 prescriptions for pharmacies, 100 for drugs) may need adjustment
-- 3. Does not account for seasonal variations or temporal trends
-- 4. Limited to available pharmacy classifications in the data

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add geographic analysis by combining with other MEPS tables
-- 2. Include temporal trends to show changing pharmacy utilization patterns
-- 3. Add drug classification analysis to show therapeutic category distributions
-- 4. Compare chain vs independent pharmacy patterns
-- 5. Analyze prescription patterns by pharmacy type and patient demographics

    - Additional Notes: The query provides insights into pharmacy distribution networks but may need threshold adjustments (1000 prescriptions for pharmacies, 100 for drugs) based on the specific analysis period and data volume. Consider pharmacy type classifications in the data before drawing conclusions about pharmacy categories.
