/*
Query Mechanics:
- Aggregates healthcare expenditures and utilization across demographics
- Provides average spending by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and insurance status
- Filters out records with missing expenditure data

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Uses MEPS panel data from 2015-2021
- Expenditure data may be top-coded or anonymized
- Results represent a sample, not entire population

Potential Extensions:
1. Time-series analysis of healthcare spending trends
2. Predictive modeling of healthcare costs
3. Correlation with specific health conditions
4. Comparative analysis across different insurance types
