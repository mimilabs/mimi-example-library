-- CCVI County Vulnerability Analysis: Strategic COVID-19 Resource Allocation

/*
Business Purpose:
- Identify counties with the highest COVID-19 vulnerability
- Enable targeted public health and economic intervention strategies
- Support data-driven resource allocation across U.S. counties

/*
Query Mechanics:
- Uses window functions to rank counties by vulnerability
- Calculates state-level vulnerability metrics
- Focuses on top 100 most vulnerable counties nationwide

Assumptions:
- Higher CCVI score indicates greater vulnerability
- All theme scores contribute equally to overall vulnerability
- Data represents a specific point in time

Potential Extensions:
1. Correlate vulnerability scores with actual COVID-19 case/death rates
2. Create predictive models for resource allocation
3. Develop interactive geospatial visualizations
4. Trend analysis of vulnerability over time

Recommended Next Steps:
- Validate results with domain experts
- Cross-reference with additional demographic datasets
- Develop targeted intervention strategies

    - Additional Notes: Provides a high-level analysis of COVID-19 vulnerability across U.S. counties, focusing on state-level aggregations and top 100 most vulnerable counties. Requires careful interpretation and should be used as part of a comprehensive public health strategy.
