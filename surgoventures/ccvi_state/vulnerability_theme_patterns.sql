-- state_vulnerability_theme_correlation.sql

/*
Business Purpose:
This analysis examines the relationships between different vulnerability themes across states
to identify which risk factors tend to occur together. Understanding these correlations helps
policymakers and healthcare organizations develop more comprehensive and efficient
intervention strategies by addressing multiple related vulnerabilities simultaneously.

The correlation analysis reveals which vulnerability factors commonly cluster together,
allowing for more targeted and cost-effective resource allocation and policy planning.

/*
How it works:
1. First CTE calculates correlation coefficients between key theme pairs
2. Second CTE identifies states with multiple high-risk themes
3. Final query combines correlation insights with state-specific findings

Assumptions and limitations:
- Uses 0.75 as threshold for "high risk" (top quartile)
- Focuses on selected theme pairs rather than all possible combinations
- Correlation analysis assumes linear relationships between themes
- Point-in-time analysis that doesn't reflect temporal changes

Possible extensions:
1. Add geographic clustering analysis to identify regional patterns
2. Include time series analysis if historical data is available
3. Incorporate additional external factors like vaccination rates
4. Create risk categories based on specific theme combinations
5. Add demographic weighting to correlation calculations

    - Additional Notes: The query focuses on vulnerability pattern analysis by examining correlations between themes and identifying multi-risk states. Performance may be impacted with large datasets due to correlation calculations. Consider adding indexes on theme columns if frequent analysis is needed.
