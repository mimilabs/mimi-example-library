-- Title: Comprehensive Medication Prescription Pattern Analysis

-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze the holistic medication prescription landscape to understand:
-- - Medication diversity and distribution across patient populations
-- - Underlying health condition insights through medication prescriptions
-- - Potential opportunities for healthcare cost optimization and intervention strategies

-- Query Operational Details:
-- 1. Aggregates medication prescription data
-- 2. Calculates comprehensive metrics per medication
-- 3. Categorizes medications by total expenditure
-- 4. Provides a ranked view of medication impact

-- Key Assumptions:
-- - Assumes complete and consistent medication record entries
-- - Uses synthetic data with potential statistical limitations
-- - Focuses on aggregate trends rather than individual patient details

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Incorporate patient demographic segmentation
-- 2. Add temporal trend analysis
-- 3. Integrate with patient diagnosis data for deeper insights
-- 4. Include payer-specific medication utilization patterns
