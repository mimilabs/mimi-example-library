-- payer_coverage_intensity_analysis.sql
-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze the intensity and volatility of health insurance coverage
-- Key Insights:
-- - Quantify payer coverage complexity for risk management
-- - Identify patients with high insurance transition frequency
-- - Support strategic payer engagement and retention strategies

-- Query Mechanics:
-- 1. First CTE (patient_coverage_metrics) calculates individual patient coverage complexity
-- 2. Second CTE (payer_transition_frequency) analyzes ownership-level transition patterns
-- 3. Final SELECT combines individual and aggregate insights

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- - Uses synthesized data, so real-world patterns may differ
-- - Assumes linear coverage periods without complex overlaps
-- - Limited by synthetic dataset's representativeness

-- Potential Extensions:
-- - Add age or demographic segmentation
-- - Incorporate time-based trend analysis
-- - Develop predictive models for coverage volatility

    - Additional Notes: Synthesizes patient insurance coverage metrics across different ownership types, providing insights into coverage intensity and transition patterns. Requires careful interpretation due to synthetic data limitations.
