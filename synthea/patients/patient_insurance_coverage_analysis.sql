-- Query Mechanics:
-- 1. Aggregates patient data by gender, marital status, and race
-- 2. Calculates average healthcare coverage and identifies low-coverage segments
-- 3. Ranks market segments by potential insurance product opportunities

-- Assumptions:
-- - Healthcare coverage represents potential insurance market
-- - Lower coverage indicates higher product placement opportunity
-- - Population segments with more low-coverage patients are prime targets

-- Potential Extensions:
-- 1. Include geographic segmentation (state/county)
-- 2. Add correlation with healthcare expenses
-- 3. Integrate with claims or clinical data for deeper insights

-- Business Value:
-- Provides actionable intelligence for:
-- - Targeted insurance product development
-- - Market segment prioritization
-- - Customer acquisition strategies
