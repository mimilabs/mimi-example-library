-- medicaid_child_preventive_care.sql

-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyzes state performance on key child preventive care measures to identify opportunities 
-- for improving early intervention and health outcomes. This analysis helps healthcare 
-- administrators and policymakers understand where to focus resources and interventions
-- for maximum impact on children's health.

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to identify relevant preventive care measures
-- 2. Joins main quality table with preventive measures
-- 3. Calculates performance tiers and deviation from median
-- 4. Filters for most recent year and valid rates
-- 5. Orders results to highlight top performers

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Focuses only on prevention domain measures
-- - Uses most recent year's data only
-- - Assumes higher rates are better (check measure_type for exceptions)
-- - State_rate must be non-null for inclusion
-- - Performance tiers based on quartile calculations

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year trend analysis
-- 2. Include population size/demographics context
-- 3. Add geographic region grouping
-- 4. Expand to include other domains
-- 5. Create composite prevention score by state
-- 6. Add correlation analysis with social determinants of health
-- 7. Include cost effectiveness metrics
-- 8. Add benchmarking against national goals/targets

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on state-level performance analysis of child preventive care measures in Medicaid/CHIP programs. The performance tiers and median comparisons provide quick insights for identifying both successful programs and areas needing intervention. Note that the analysis is limited to the prevention domain and most recent reporting year, which may not capture longer-term trends or improvements in progress.
