-- medicaid_prescribing_volume_patterns.sql

-- Business Purpose: Analyze prescription volume patterns across states and utilization types 
-- (Fee-for-Service vs Managed Care) to identify high-volume states and potential variations
-- in care delivery models. This analysis helps healthcare organizations and policymakers 
-- understand market opportunities and operational differences between states.

-- How this query works:
-- 1. First CTE aggregates quarterly prescription volumes by state and utilization type
-- 2. Second CTE calculates average metrics and rankings for each state
-- 3. Final query filters to top 10 states by volume for each utilization type

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Excludes suppressed data which may impact completeness for smaller states
-- - Focus on recent years (2018+) assumes current patterns are most relevant
-- - Does not account for state population differences
-- - Rankings based on prescription volume may not reflect program efficiency

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add per capita calculations using state population data
-- 2. Analyze seasonality patterns in prescription volumes
-- 3. Compare FFS vs MCO penetration rates across states
-- 4. Add year-over-year growth rates
-- 5. Incorporate drug class analysis for volume drivers
-- 6. Add reimbursement per prescription metrics

    - Additional Notes: Query reveals state-level prescription patterns and rankings, focusing on volume metrics across both Fee-for-Service and Managed Care programs. Note that results exclude states with suppressed data and may underrepresent smaller states. Consider state population differences when interpreting results.
