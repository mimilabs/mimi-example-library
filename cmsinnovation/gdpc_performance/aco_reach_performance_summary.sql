-- ACO REACH Performance Analysis: Core Metrics and Financial Impact
-- 
-- Business Purpose:
-- This query analyzes key performance indicators of ACO REACH participants to understand:
-- 1. Financial performance across different DCE types and risk arrangements
-- 2. Scale of operations (beneficiary coverage)
-- 3. Quality score impact on performance
-- 4. Geographic distribution of successful programs

-- How This Query Works:
-- 1. Creates a CTE to aggregate key metrics by state, DCE type, and risk arrangement
-- 2. Calculates financial impact in millions of dollars and as percentage rates
-- 3. Measures program reach through beneficiary counts
-- 4. Incorporates quality scores to understand performance holistically
-- 5. Filters for meaningful groupings and orders by financial impact

-- Assumptions & Limitations:
-- 1. Assumes net_savings_loss values are in dollars
-- 2. Groups with single DCE filtered out to protect confidentiality
-- 3. Does not account for temporal changes (point-in-time analysis)
-- 4. Quality scores equally weighted in analysis

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add year-over-year performance comparison
-- 2. Include specific quality measure analysis (qualityA through qualityL)
-- 3. Add geographic region groupings for regional analysis
-- 4. Incorporate benchmark achievement analysis
-- 5. Add risk-adjustment metrics for fairer comparisons
-- 6. Create performance tiers based on composite scoring

    - Additional Notes: Query aggregates key ACO REACH metrics by state, type, and risk arrangement. Filters ensure data privacy by excluding groups with single DCE. Financial values in millions USD. Consider time zone settings when deploying as performance dates may be impacted.
