-- Title: ACO REACH County Payment Rate Analysis - Core Business Value Demonstration

/*
Business Purpose:
This query analyzes county-level payment rates for the ACO REACH program to:
1. Identify highest-value geographic opportunities by comparing county rates
2. Track year-over-year changes in payment rates
3. Reveal geographic variations in healthcare costs through GAF trends
4. Support strategic market entry decisions for healthcare organizations

The analysis provides insights for:
- Healthcare organizations evaluating ACO REACH participation
- Strategic planning teams assessing market opportunities
- Financial analysts projecting potential revenue impacts

/*
How the Query Works:
1. Creates a CTE for the most recent performance year data
2. Calculates state-level summary statistics
3. Joins county-level data with state summaries
4. Adds derived metrics for business decision-making

Assumptions and Limitations:
- Assumes current performance year data is complete
- Focuses on county_rate as primary measure of opportunity
- Does not account for competition or market penetration
- GAF trends may not capture all market dynamics

Possible Extensions:
1. Add year-over-year trend analysis:
   - Include previous years' rates
   - Calculate compound annual growth rates

2. Enhance opportunity scoring:
   - Include demographic data
   - Add Medicare Advantage penetration
   - Factor in provider density

3. Geographic clustering:
   - Group adjacent counties
   - Create market opportunity zones
   - Calculate regional statistics

4. Risk adjustment:
   - Include population health metrics
   - Factor in social determinants of health
   - Adjust for local healthcare infrastructure

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on county-level payment rate variations and identifies market opportunities based on rate differentials from state averages. Performance may be impacted when processing states with large numbers of counties. Results most relevant for the latest performance year only.
