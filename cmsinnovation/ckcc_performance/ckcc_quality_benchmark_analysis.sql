-- Business Purpose:
-- Analyze the relationship between quality scores and financial benchmarks across 
-- different agreement options to identify patterns in care delivery effectiveness.
-- This helps understand how quality performance correlates with cost benchmarks
-- and supports strategic decision-making for program improvements.

-- How this query works:
-- 1. Creates quality tiers based on total quality scores
-- 2. Joins with financial and beneficiary metrics
-- 3. Calculates average performance metrics by tier and agreement option
-- 4. Orders results to show natural progression of quality levels

-- Assumptions and Limitations:
-- - Assumes quality scores are on 0-1 scale
-- - Requires non-null quality scores and positive benchmarks
-- - Aggregates at organization level, masking individual variation
-- - Does not account for geographic or demographic factors

-- Possible Extensions:
-- 1. Add trending analysis across performance periods
-- 2. Include geographic analysis by state presence
-- 3. Add statistical significance testing between tiers
-- 4. Incorporate risk score adjustments
-- 5. Add detailed quality measure breakdowns

    - Additional Notes: Query focuses on stratified quality tiers (high/medium/needs improvement) and their relationship to financial benchmarks across different agreement options. Note that the quality score thresholds (0.9 and 0.7) may need adjustment based on program requirements, and the analysis assumes complete data for quality scores and benchmarks.
