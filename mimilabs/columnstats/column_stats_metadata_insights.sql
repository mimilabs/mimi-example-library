-- Purpose: Extract Strategic Metadata Insights from MimiLabs Column Statistics

-- Business Context:
-- This query analyzes the column metadata to provide a comprehensive view 
-- of data structure, helping data teams understand schema composition, 
-- data type distribution, and potential data exploration opportunities.

WITH data_type_summary AS (
    -- Aggregate and analyze data type distribution across schemas
    SELECT 
        data_type,
        COUNT(DISTINCT schema || '.' || table) AS unique_table_count,
        COUNT(*) AS total_column_count,
        ROUND(COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () * 100, 2) AS percentage_of_total
    FROM mimi_ws_1.mimilabs.columnstats
    GROUP BY data_type
),

schema_column_complexity AS (
    -- Identify schemas with most complex table structures
    SELECT 
        schema,
        COUNT(DISTINCT table) AS table_count,
        COUNT(*) AS total_columns,
        ROUND(AVG(LENGTH(column)), 2) AS avg_column_name_length,
        COUNT(DISTINCT data_type) AS unique_data_types
    FROM mimi_ws_1.mimilabs.columnstats
    GROUP BY schema
)

-- Primary Business Insights Query
SELECT 
    'Data Type Distribution' AS insight_category,
    data_type,
    unique_table_count,
    total_column_count,
    percentage_of_total,
    
    -- Schema Complexity Context
    scc.table_count AS related_table_count,
    scc.unique_data_types AS schema_data_type_diversity
FROM data_type_summary dts
JOIN schema_column_complexity scc ON 1=1
ORDER BY total_column_count DESC
LIMIT 15;

-- Query Methodology:
-- 1. Creates CTE for data type distribution analysis
-- 2. Generates schema-level column complexity metrics
-- 3. Joins insights to provide comprehensive metadata view

-- Limitations:
-- - Snapshot of metadata at specific point in time
-- - Does not reflect real-time data changes
-- - Provides structural insights, not data content analysis

-- Potential Extensions:
-- - Add filters for specific schemas or data types
-- - Incorporate data freshness metrics
-- - Create visualization of column type distributions

    - Additional Notes: This query provides a comprehensive analysis of column metadata, offering insights into data type distribution and schema complexity. It helps data teams understand the structural composition of their datasets, but relies on a snapshot of metadata that may not reflect real-time changes.
