Query Mechanics:
- Two-stage CTE approach for comprehensive analysis
- First CTE: Content attribute extraction
- Second CTE: Sender communication profiling
- Final SELECT: Strategic communication insights

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes consistent email content structure
- Relies on simple keyword matching
- Does not capture nuanced semantic meaning

Potential Extensions:
1. Implement more advanced NLP for topic modeling
2. Integrate with email engagement metrics
3. Create time-series communication trend analysis
4. Develop sender influence scoring mechanism
