/*
Query Mechanics:
- Uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to modularize analysis
- Calculates sender-level email metrics
- Identifies top email subjects
- Joins sender metrics with most frequent subjects

Assumptions & Limitations:
- Assumes complete and consistent data in the kff_emails table
- May not capture nuanced content themes
- Limited to top 15 results for readability

Potential Extensions:
1. Add sentiment analysis on email content
2. Incorporate time-based trend analysis
3. Implement more advanced text mining techniques
4. Create visualization-ready aggregations
